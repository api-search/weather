Its features include findings for external and unused access, basic and custom policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to generate fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to identify external or unused access, you first need to create an analyzer.</p> <p> <b>External access analyzers</b> help identify potential risks of accessing resources by enabling you to identify any resource policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes.</p> <p> <b>Unused access analyzers</b> help identify potential identity access risks by enabling you to identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level permissions.</p> <p>Beyond findings, IAM Access Analyzer provides basic and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies before deploying permissions changes. You can use policy generation to refine permissions by attaching a policy generated using access activity logged in CloudTrail logs. </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically.

You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/appconfig/latest/userguide/what-is-appconfig.html">AppConfig User Guide</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p> CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client. </p> <p> <b>CodeArtifact Components</b> </p> <p>Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Repository</b>: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/welcome.html#welcome-concepts-package-version">package versions</a>, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the <b> <code>npm</code> </b> CLI, the Maven CLI (<b> <code>mvn</code> </b>), Python CLIs (<b> <code>pip</code> </b> and <code>twine</code>), and NuGet CLIs (<code>nuget</code> and <code>dotnet</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Domain</b>: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a <i>domain</i>. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key Management Service (KMS).</p> <p>Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain.</p> <p>The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages.</p> <p>Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package</b>: A <i>package</i> is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-npm.html">npm</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-python.html">PyPI</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-maven">Maven</a>, and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/ug/using-nuget">NuGet</a> package formats.</p> <p>In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:</p> <ul> <li> <p>A <i>name</i> (for example, <code>webpack</code> is the name of a popular npm package)</p> </li> <li> <p>An optional namespace (for example, <code>@types</code> in <code>@types/node</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>A set of versions (for example, <code>1.0.0</code>, <code>1.0.1</code>, <code>1.0.2</code>, etc.)</p> </li> <li> <p> Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p> <b>Package version</b>: A version of a package, such as <code>@types/node 12.6.9</code>. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning specification</a>. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Upstream repository</b>: One repository is <i>upstream</i> of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Asset</b>: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm <code>.tgz</code> file or Maven POM and JAR files.</p> </li> </ul> <p>CodeArtifact supports these operations:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>AssociateExternalConnection</code>: Adds an existing external connection to a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CopyPackageVersions</code>: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateDomain</code>: Creates a domain</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CreateRepository</code>: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomain</code>: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy</code>: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeletePackage</code>: Deletes a package and all associated package versions.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeletePackageVersions</code>: Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteRepository</code>: Deletes a repository. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy</code>: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribeDomain</code>: Returns a <code>DomainDescription</code> object that contains information about the requested domain.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribePackage</code>: Returns a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageDescription.html">PackageDescription</a> object that contains details about a package. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribePackageVersion</code>: Returns a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeartifact/latest/APIReference/API_PackageVersionDescription.html">PackageVersionDescription</a> object that contains details about a package version. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DescribeRepository</code>: Returns a <code>RepositoryDescription</code> object that contains detailed information about the requested repository. </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>DisposePackageVersions</code>: Disposes versions of a package.

For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both.

    "description": "<fullname>CodePipeline</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>This is the CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/welcome.html">CodePipeline User Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can use the CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.</p> <p> <i>Pipelines</i> are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. </p> <p>You can work with pipelines by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePipeline</a>, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeletePipeline</a>, which deletes the specified pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineExecution</a>, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListActionExecutions</a>, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelines</a>, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPipelineExecutions</a>, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartPipelineExecution</a>, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopPipelineExecution</a>, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdatePipeline</a>, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines include <i>stages</i>. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call <a>GetPipelineState</a>, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or <a>GetPipeline</a>, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/pipeline-structure.html">CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference</a>.</p> <p>Pipeline stages include <i>actions</i> that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as <a>CreatePipeline</a> and <a>GetPipelineState</a>. Valid action categories are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Source</p> </li> <li> <p>Build</p> </li> <li> <p>Test</p> </li> <li> <p>Deploy</p> </li> <li> <p>Approval</p> </li> <li> <p>Invoke</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pipelines also include <i>transitions</i>, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete.</p> <p>You can work with transitions by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>DisableStageTransition</a>, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>EnableStageTransition</a>, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Using the API to integrate with CodePipeline</b> </p> <p>For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:</p> <p> <b>Jobs</b>, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. </p> <p>You can work with jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetJobDetails</a>, which returns the details of a job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Third party jobs</b>, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the Amazon Web Services Partner Network.</p> <p>You can work with third party jobs by calling:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob</a>, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetThirdPartyJobDetails</a>, which requests the details of a job for a partner action.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PollForThirdPartyJobs</a>, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult</a>, which provides details of a job failure.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult</a>, which provides details of a job success.</p> </li> </ul>",

High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it's available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don't need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.</p> <p>With Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity.

    "description": "<fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname> <p>A load balancer distributes incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check settings to be used when checking the health status of the targets.</p> <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load balancer types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Application Load Balancer - Operates at the application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gateway Load Balancer - Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p> <p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time.

This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>Global Accelerator is a service in which you create <i>accelerators</i> to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. </p> <ul> <li> <p>By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network. </p> </li> <li> <p>For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.</p> </li> </ul> <important> <p>Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify <code>--region us-west-2</code> on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.</p> </important> <p>By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP). </p> <p>For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.</p> <important> <p>The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/access-control-manage-access-tag-policies.html">Tag-based policies</a>.</p> </important> <p>For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.</p> <p>For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/what-is-global-accelerator.html">Global Accelerator Developer Guide</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p> <b>Introduction</b> </p> <p>The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an Amazon Web Services EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors.</p> <p>The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ivs.html">Amazon IVS page</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <i> <b>All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. </b> </i> </p> <p>For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/doc-history.html"> Document History</a>.</p> <p> <b>Allowed Header Values</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept:</b> </code> application/json</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> </code> gzip, deflate</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <b>Content-Type:</b> </code>application/json</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Resources</b> </p> <p>The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/getting-started.html"> Getting Started with Amazon IVS</a>):</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Channel</b> — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Stream key</b> — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information. <i> <b>Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.</b> </i> </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback key pair</b> — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Recording configuration</b> — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Playback restriction policy</b> — Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites. See the Playback Restriction Policy endpoints for more information.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Tagging</b> </p> <p>A <i>tag</i> is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i>, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as <code>topic:nature</code> to label a particular video category. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html">Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources</a> for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and "Tag naming limits and requirements"; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there.</p> <p>Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_tags.html"> Access Tags</a>). </p> <p>The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: <a>TagResource</a>, <a>UntagResource</a>, and <a>ListTagsForResource</a>. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations.</p> <p>At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource. </p> <p> <b>Authentication versus Authorization</b> </p> <p>Note the differences between these concepts:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Authentication</i> is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Authorization</i> is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization is needed to view <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Amazon IVS private channels</a>. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for "playback authorization.")</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Authentication</b> </p> <p>All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests.</p> <p>You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from a user account that has the <code>ivs:PutMetadata</code> permission.</p> <p>For more information:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Authentication and generating signatures — See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity and Access Management</a> on the Security page of the <i>Amazon IVS User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)</b> </p> <p>ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html">Amazon Resource Names</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>.</p> <p> <b>Channel Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateChannel</a> — Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetChannel</a> — Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetChannel</a> — Performs <a>GetChannel</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListChannels</a> — Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 Conflict Exception).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdateChannel</a> — Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteChannel</a> — Deletes the specified channel.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Playback Restriction Policy Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreatePlaybackRestrictionPolicy</a> — Creates a new playback restriction policy, for constraining playback by countries and/or origins.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeletePlaybackRestrictionPolicy</a> — Deletes the specified playback restriction policy</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPlaybackRestrictionPolicy</a> — Gets the specified playback restriction policy.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListPlaybackRestrictionPolicies</a> — Gets summary information about playback restriction policies.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UpdatePlaybackRestrictionPolicy</a> — Updates a specified playback restriction policy.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Private Channel Endpoints</b> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/private-channels.html">Setting Up Private Channels</a> in the <i>Amazon IVS User Guide</i>.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ImportPlaybackKeyPair</a> — Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>. The <code>privateKey</code> can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization).</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetPlaybackKeyPair</a> — Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the <code>arn</code> and <code>fingerprint</code>.

This invalidates future viewer tokens generated using the key pair’s <code>privateKey</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StartViewerSessionRevocation</a> — Starts the process of revoking the viewer session associated with a specified channel ARN and viewer ID. Optionally, you can provide a version to revoke viewer sessions less than and including that version.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchStartViewerSessionRevocation</a> — Performs <a>StartViewerSessionRevocation</a> on multiple channel ARN and viewer ID pairs simultaneously.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>RecordingConfiguration Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateRecordingConfiguration</a> — Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetRecordingConfiguration</a> — Gets the recording-configuration metadata for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListRecordingConfigurations</a> — Gets summary information about all recording configurations in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteRecordingConfiguration</a> — Deletes the recording configuration for the specified ARN.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Stream Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>GetStream</a> — Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetStreamSession</a> — Gets metadata on a specified stream.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreams</a> — Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreamSessions</a> — Gets a summary of current and previous streams for a specified channel in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>StopStream</a> — Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with <a>DeleteStreamKey</a> to prevent further streaming to a channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>PutMetadata</a> — Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified channel. At most 5 requests per second per channel are allowed, each with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is not sufficient for your needs, we recommend batching your data into a single PutMetadata call.) At most 155 requests per second per account are allowed.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>StreamKey Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>CreateStreamKey</a> — Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>GetStreamKey</a> — Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>BatchGetStreamKey</a> — Performs <a>GetStreamKey</a> on multiple ARNs simultaneously.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListStreamKeys</a> — Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteStreamKey</a> — Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Tags Endpoints</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>TagResource</a> — Adds or updates tags for the Amazon Web Services resource with the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>UntagResource</a> — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a>ListTagsForResource</a> — Gets information about Amazon Web Services tags for the specified ARN.</p> </li> </ul>",

    "description": "<fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/"> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>KMS key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All KMS requests must be signed with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html">Amazon Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications.

CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Monitor CloudTrail logged events</b>: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail.

For general information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-apis.html">Amazon Web Services APIs</a>. </p> <p>To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: <code>https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com </code> </p> </li> <li> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/">Network Firewall Developer Guide</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the <a href="https://suricata.io/">Suricata website</a>.</p> <p>You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.</p> </li> <li> <p>Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/">Amazon VPC User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To start using Network Firewall, do the following: </p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior. </p> </li> <li> <p>In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.</p> </li> </ol>",

You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.</p> <p> <b>Glossary of terms</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Server</b>: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Engine</b>: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include <code>ChefAutomate</code> and <code>Puppet</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Backup</b>: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Events</b>: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Account attributes</b>: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.</p> <ul> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> <li> <p>opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/opsworks-service.html">AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas</a> in the AWS General Reference.</p> <p> <b>Throttling limits</b> </p> <p>All API operations allow for five requests per second with a burst of 10 requests per second.</p>",

For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide</a>.</p> <p>The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments.</p> <p>Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations.</p> <p>When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on Proton, developers need permissions to the service <i>create</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>update</i> and <i>delete</i> API operations and the service instance <i>list</i> and <i>update</i> API operations.</p> <p>To learn more about Proton, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/userguide/Welcome.html">Proton User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Ensuring Idempotency</b> </p> <p>When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.</p> <p> <i>Idempotency</i> ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status.</p> <p>The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.</p> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs with a client token</b> </p> <p>The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a <i>client token</i>. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you <i>don't</i> reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.</p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created.</p> <p>If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs with a client token:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent create APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource <i>hasn't</i> been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.</p> <p>If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a <code>ConflictException</code>.</p> <p>If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a <code>ValidationException</code> with an <code>IdempotentParameterMismatch</code> error.</p> <p>Idempotent create APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>CreateEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateEnvironment</p> </li> <li> <p>CreateService</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Idempotent delete APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response.</p> <p>If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty.</p> <p>In both cases, the retry succeeds.</p> <p>Idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteServiceTemplate</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteServiceTemplateVersion</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs</b> </p> <p>Given a request action that has succeeded:</p> <p>If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions.</p> <p>If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response.</p> <p>Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DeleteEnvironment</p> </li> <li> <p>DeleteService</p> </li> </ul>",

Note that Amazon Redshift is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces may require techniques, such as polling or asynchronous callback handlers, to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a change is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the next maintenance window. For a summary of the Amazon Redshift cluster management interfaces, go to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/using-aws-sdk.html">Using the Amazon Redshift Management Interfaces</a>.</p> <p>Amazon Redshift manages all the work of setting up, operating, and scaling a data warehouse: provisioning capacity, monitoring and backing up the cluster, and applying patches and upgrades to the Amazon Redshift engine. You can focus on using your data to acquire new insights for your business and customers.</p> <p>If you are a first-time user of Amazon Redshift, we recommend that you begin by reading the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/gsg/getting-started.html">Amazon Redshift Getting Started Guide</a>.</p> <p>If you are a database developer, the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/welcome.html">Amazon Redshift Database Developer Guide</a> explains how to design, build, query, and maintain the databases that make up your data warehouse. </p>",

To implement failover, you set one routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html"> Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create clusters, control panels, and routing controls by using API operations.

You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data.</p> <p>The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you retain ownership over your data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake, CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings. Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data that's stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data analytics.</p>",

These include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices.</p> <p>In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web Services and supported third-party products.</p> <p>Security Hub offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues. For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to specific findings.</p> <p>This guide, the <i>Security Hub API Reference</i>, provides information about the Security Hub API. This includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas.

The user guide explains key concepts and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features. It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub with other Amazon Web Services.</p> <p>In addition to interacting with Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically.

Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the change.

You can use Verified Permissions to manage permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant access based on information about the users, resources, and requested actions. You can also evaluate additional information like group membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time of request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these permissions by letting you create and store authorization policies for your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise business systems.</p> <p>Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy language to express your permission requirements. Cedar supports both role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) authorization models.</p> <p>For more information about configuring, administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your applications, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/">Amazon Verified Permissions User Guide</a>.</p> <p>For more information about the Cedar policy language, see the <a href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/">Cedar Policy Language Guide</a>.</p> <important> <p>When you write Cedar policies that reference principals, resources and actions, you can define the unique identifiers used for each of those elements. We strongly recommend that you follow these best practices:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Use values like universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.</b> </p> <p>For example, if user <code>jane</code> leaves the company, and you later let someone else use the name <code>jane</code>, then that new user automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still reference <code>User::"jane"</code>. Cedar can’t distinguish between the new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of the presence of an old identifier in a policy.</p> <p>Where you use a UUID for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your policies easier to understand. For example: principal == User::"a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111", // alice</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information as part of the unique identifier for your principals or resources.</b> These identifiers are included in log entries shared in CloudTrail trails.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <p>Several operations return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes. As new functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter of one operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense for the same parameter in a different operation. To help you understand the purpose of each, the following naming convention is used for the structures:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Detail</code> are used in <code>Get</code> operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that end in <code>Item</code> are used in <code>List</code> operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Parameter type structures that use neither suffix are used in the mutating (create and update) operations.</p> </li> </ul>",

The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. </p> <p>This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.</p> </li> </ul>",

    "description": "# IntroductionThe Microsoft Translator Text API provides a JSON-based Web API. It provides:  * Translation between any supported languages to any other supported language.  * Translation to multiple languages in one request.  * Transliteration to convert text from one script to another script of the same language.  * Language detection, translation, and transliteration in one request.  * Dictionary to lookup alternative translations of a term, to find back-translations and examples showing terms used in context.  * Rich language detection.# Base URLsThe Translator Text API is available in the following clouds:| Description | Region    | Base URL                                || -------     | --------  | -------                                 || Azure       | Global    | api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com   || Azure       | Europe    | api-eur.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com |# AuthenticationSubscribe to the Translator Text API, part of Azure Cognitive Services, and use your subscription key from the Azure portal to authenticate. You can follow the steps in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/translator/translator-text-how-to-signup.The simplest way is to pass your Azure secret key to the Translator service using the http request header `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.If you prefer using a short-lived authentication, you may use your secret key to obtain an authorization token from the token service. In that case you pass the authorization token to the Translator service using the `Authorization` request header. To obtain an authorization token, make a `POST` request to the following URL:| Environment | Authentication service URL                                || ----------  | ----------                                                || Azure       | `https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken` |Here are example requests to obtain a token with a lifetime of 10 minutes, given a secret key:```python// Pass secret key using headercurl --header 'Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your-key>' --data "" 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken'// Pass secret key using query string parametercurl --data "" 'https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken?Subscription-Key=<your-key>'```A successful request returns the encoded access token as plain text in the response body. The valid token is passed to the Translator service as a bearer token in the Authorization. ```Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>```An authentication token is valid for 10 minutes. The token should be re-used when making multiple calls to the Translator APIs. If you make requests to the Translator API over an extended period of time,  you  must request a new access token at regular intervals before the token expires, for instance every 9 minutes.To summarize, a client request to the Translator API will include one authorization header taken from the following table:| Headers       | Description  || ----------    | ----------   || Ocp-Apim-Subscription-key    | Use with Cognitive Services subscription if you are passing your secret key.                               The value is the Azure secret key for your subscription to Translator Text API.                         || Authorization                | Use with Cognitive Services subscription if you are passing an authentication token. The value is the Bearer token: `Bearer <token>`.       |## All-in-one subscriptionThe last authentication option is to use a Cognitive Service’s all-in-one subscription. This allows you to use a single secret key to authenticate requests for multiple services.When you use an all-in-one secret key, you must include two authentication headers with your request. The first passes the secret key, the second specifies the region associated with your subscription.`Ocp-Api-Subscription-Key` `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region`If you pass the secret key in the query string with the parameter `Subscription-Key`, then you must specify the region with query parameter `Subscription-Region`.If you use a bearer token, you must obtain the token from the region endpoint:`https://<your-region>.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/sts/v1.0/issueToken`.Available regions are: `australiaeast`, `brazilsouth`, `canadacentral`, `centralindia`, `centraluseuap`, `eastasia`, `eastus`, `eastus2`, `japaneast`, `northeurope`, `southcentralus`, `southeastasia`, `uksouth`, `westcentralus`, `westeurope`, `westus`, and `westus2`.Region is required for the all-in-one Text API subscription.# ErrorsA standard error response is a JSON object with name/value pair named `error`. The value is also a JSON object with properties:  * `code`: A server-defined error code.  * `message`: A string giving a human-readable representation of the error.For example, a customer with a free trial subscription receives the following error once the free quota is exhausted:```json{  "error": {  "code":403000,  "message":"The subscription has exceeded its free quota."  }}```# Enter your subscription keys to try out Microsoft Translator.Select the `Authorize` button and enter your Microsoft Translator subscription key, OR your `all in one Cognitive Services` subscription key. If you are using the all in one Cognitive Services key you will need to also enter your subscription region.## Available regions are:  `australiaeast`, `brazilsouth`, `canadacentral`, `centralindia`, `centraluseuap`, `eastasia`, `eastus`, `eastus2`, `japaneast`, `northeurope`, `southcentralus`, `southeastasia`, `uksouth`, `westcentralus`, `westeurope`, `westus`, `westus2`.",
