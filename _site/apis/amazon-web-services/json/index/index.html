"description": "Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps you to set, verify, and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities. Its features include findings for external and unused access, basic and custom policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to generate fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to identify external or unused access, you first need to create an analyzer.  External access analyzers help identify potential risks of accessing resources by enabling you to identify any resource policies that grant access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment. An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service, or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview public and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions changes.  Unused access analyzers help identify potential identity access risks by enabling you to identify unused IAM roles, unused access keys, unused console passwords, and IAM principals with unused service and action-level permissions. Beyond findings, IAM Access Analyzer provides basic and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies before deploying permissions changes. You can use policy generation to refine permissions by attaching a policy generated using access activity logged in CloudTrail logs.  This guide describes the IAM Access Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about IAM Access Analyzer, see Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer in the IAM User Guide.",

AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid. During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version.  AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples:    Feature flags: Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement.     Application tuning: Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic.    Allow list: Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content.

Using the latest versions requires migrating to dedicated namespaces. For more information, refer to Migrating from the Amazon Chime namespace in the Amazon Chime SDK Developer Guide.  The Amazon Chime application programming interface (API) is designed so administrators can perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice Connectors. This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API, including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls for Amazon Chime. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the AWS CLI. The page for each API action contains a See Also section that includes links to information about using the action with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.  Using an AWS SDK   You don't need to write code to calculate a signature for request authentication. The SDK clients authenticate your requests by using access keys that you provide. For more information about AWS SDKs, see the AWS Developer Center.   Using the AWS CLI  Use your access keys with the AWS CLI to make API calls. For information about setting up the AWS CLI, see Installing the AWS Command Line Interface in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. For a list of available Amazon Chime commands, see the Amazon Chime commands in the AWS CLI Command Reference.   Using REST APIs  If you use REST to make API calls, you must authenticate your request by providing a signature. Amazon Chime supports Signature Version 4. For more information, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. When making REST API calls, use the service name chime and REST endpoint https://service.chime.aws.amazon.com.   Administrative permissions are controlled using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).

{
"name": "AWS CodeArtifact",
"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": " CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, pip, and dotnet. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client.   CodeArtifact Components  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components:    Repository: A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the  npm  CLI, the Maven CLI ( mvn ), Python CLIs ( pip  and twine), and NuGet CLIs (nuget and dotnet).    Domain: Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a domain. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in Key Management Service (KMS). Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain. The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages. Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization.    Package: A package is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports npm, PyPI, Maven, and NuGet package formats. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of:   A name (for example, webpack is the name of a popular npm package)   An optional namespace (for example, @types in @types/node)   A set of versions (for example, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.)    Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags)      Package version: A version of a package, such as @types/node 12.6.9. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the Semantic Versioning specification. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets.    Upstream repository: One repository is upstream of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories.    Asset: An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm .tgz file or Maven POM and JAR files.   CodeArtifact supports these operations:    AssociateExternalConnection: Adds an existing external connection to a repository.     CopyPackageVersions: Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain.    CreateDomain: Creates a domain    CreateRepository: Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain.     DeleteDomain: Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories.     DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain.    DeletePackage: Deletes a package and all associated package versions.    DeletePackageVersions: Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    DeleteRepository: Deletes a repository.     DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository.    DescribeDomain: Returns a DomainDescription object that contains information about the requested domain.    DescribePackage: Returns a PackageDescription object that contains details about a package.     DescribePackageVersion: Returns a PackageVersionDescription object that contains details about a package version.     DescribeRepository: Returns a RepositoryDescription object that contains detailed information about the requested repository.     DisposePackageVersions: Disposes versions of a package. A package version with the status Disposed cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage.    DisassociateExternalConnection: Removes an existing external connection from a repository.     GetAuthorizationToken: Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. The token expires the authorization period has passed. The default authorization period is 12 hours and can be customized to any length with a maximum of 12 hours.    GetDomainPermissionsPolicy: Returns the policy of a resource that is attached to the specified domain.     GetPackageVersionAsset: Returns the contents of an asset that is in a package version.     GetPackageVersionReadme: Gets the readme file or descriptive text for a package version.    GetRepositoryEndpoint: Returns the endpoint of a repository for a specific package format. A repository has one endpoint for each package format:     maven     npm     nuget     pypi       GetRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Returns the resource policy that is set on a repository.     ListDomains: Returns a list of DomainSummary objects. Each returned DomainSummary object contains information about a domain.    ListPackages: Lists the packages in a repository.    ListPackageVersionAssets: Lists the assets for a given package version.    ListPackageVersionDependencies: Returns a list of the direct dependencies for a package version.     ListPackageVersions: Returns a list of package versions for a specified package in a repository.    ListRepositories: Returns a list of repositories owned by the Amazon Web Services account that called this method.    ListRepositoriesInDomain: Returns a list of the repositories in a domain.    PublishPackageVersion: Creates a new package version containing one or more assets.    PutDomainPermissionsPolicy: Attaches a resource policy to a domain.    PutPackageOriginConfiguration: Sets the package origin configuration for a package, which determine how new versions of the package can be added to a specific repository.    PutRepositoryPermissionsPolicy: Sets the resource policy on a repository that specifies permissions to access it.     UpdatePackageVersionsStatus: Updates the status of one or more versions of a package.    UpdateRepository: Updates the properties of a repository.  ",

"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": "CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service. You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use CodeDeploy. CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments.  CodeDeploy Components  Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeDeploy components:    Application: A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment.    Deployment group: A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An Amazon EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings.    Deployment configuration: A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by CodeDeploy during a deployment.    Deployment: The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances.     Application revisions: For an Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID.   This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.

"name": "AWS CodePipeline",
"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": "CodePipeline  Overview  This is the CodePipeline API Reference. This guide provides descriptions of the actions and data types for CodePipeline. Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the CodePipeline User Guide. You can use the CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions.  Pipelines are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions.  You can work with pipelines by calling:    CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline.    DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline.    GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN).    GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline.    GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline.    ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details.    ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account.    ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline.    StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline.    StopPipelineExecution, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline.    UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline.   Pipelines include stages. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call GetPipelineState, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference. Pipeline stages include actions that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are:   Source   Build   Test   Deploy   Approval   Invoke   Pipelines also include transitions, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete. You can work with transitions by calling:    DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline.    EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline.     Using the API to integrate with CodePipeline  For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items:  Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source.  You can work with jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.    GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job.    PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.    PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.     PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.    Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the Amazon Web Services Partner Network. You can work with third party jobs by calling:    AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job.    GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a partner action.    PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on.     PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure.    PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.  ",

"description": "AWS CodeStar Connections This Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections API Reference provides descriptions and usage examples of the operations and data types for the Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections API. You can use the connections API to work with connections and installations.  Connections are configurations that you use to connect Amazon Web Services resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection. When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one. When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a host for your connections. You can work with connections by calling:    CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline.    DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection.    GetConnection, which returns information about the connection, including the connection status.    ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your account.

Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty. The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account. To add a member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it becomes a member account in the behavior graph. Detective is also integrated with Organizations. The organization management account designates the Detective administrator account for the organization. That account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated administrator account for Detective in Organizations. The Detective administrator account can enable any organization account as a member account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite other accounts to the organization behavior graph. Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint. The administrator account for a behavior graph can use the Detective API to do the following:   Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.   View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.   Add member accounts to a behavior graph.   Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.   Apply tags to a behavior graph.   The organization management account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for Detective.

Determine whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts in the organization behavior graph.   An invited member account can use the Detective API to do the following:   View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.   Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.   Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.   Remove their account from a behavior graph.   All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail.  We replaced the term master account with the term administrator account. An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts.

"description": "Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application Discovery Service) helps you plan application migration projects. It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service FAQ.  Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers:    Agentless discovery using Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to install an agent on each host.   Agentless Collector gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment.   Agentless Collector doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information.         Agent-based discovery using the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center.    The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies.   The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Agent.        Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or Application Discovery Agent.   Third-party application discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API.   In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations.      Working With This Guide  This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs.    Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.   You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned.   API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home Region.   Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs outside the home Region, an InvalidInputException is returned.   You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.    This guide is intended for use with the Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide.  All data is handled according to the Amazon Web Services Privacy Policy. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service. ",

"description": "Global Accelerator This is the Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the Global Accelerator Developer Guide. Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits.    By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the Amazon Web Services global network.    For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.    Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create, update, or otherwise work with accelerators. That is, for example, specify --region us-west-2 on Amazon Web Services CLI commands.  By default, Global Accelerator provides you with static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the Amazon Web Services edge network. For IPv4, Global Accelerator provides two static IPv4 addresses. For dual-stack, Global Accelerator provides a total of four addresses: two static IPv4 addresses and two static IPv6 addresses. With a standard accelerator for IPv4, instead of using the addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator (BYOIP).  For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple Amazon Web Services Regions , which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one Amazon Web Services Region or multiple Amazon Web Services Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.  The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies.  For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the Amazon Web Services global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints. For more information about understanding and using Global Accelerator, see the Global Accelerator Developer Guide.",

If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error. For API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information, see Best practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys in the Amazon Web Services General Reference. You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the API. For more information, see Accessing the Health API in the Health User Guide. For authentication of requests, Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing Process.

Internet Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services captures from its global networking footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and availability for internet traffic. This is the same data that Amazon Web Services uses to monitor internet uptime and availability. With those measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness for you when there are significant problems for your end users in the different geographic locations where your application runs. Internet Monitor publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics, to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health information for geographies and networks specific to your application. Internet Monitor sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate the problem. To use Internet Monitor, you create a monitor and associate your application's resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront distributions, or WorkSpaces directories - so Internet Monitor can determine where your application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the locations and ASNs (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that communicate with your application.

As a result the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources.  IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference.

JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors. The API is an Amazon Web Services regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS page in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.   All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive.    For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see  Document History.  Allowed Header Values      Accept:  application/json     Accept-Encoding:  gzip, deflate     Content-Type: application/json    Resources  The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see  Getting Started with Amazon IVS):    Channel — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information.     Stream key — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information.  Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel.      Playback key pair — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information.    Recording configuration — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information.    Playback restriction policy — Restricts playback by countries and/or origin sites. See the Playback Restriction Policy endpoints for more information.    Tagging  A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an Amazon Web Services resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and Tag naming limits and requirements; Amazon IVS has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there. Tags can help you identify and organize your Amazon Web Services resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see  Access Tags).  The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations. At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.   Authentication versus Authorization  Note the differences between these concepts:    Authentication is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests.    Authorization is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS API requests. In addition, authorization is needed to view Amazon IVS private channels. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for playback authorization.)    Authentication  All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The Amazon Web Services Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests. You generate a signature using valid Amazon Web Services credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from a user account that has the ivs:PutMetadata permission. For more information:   Authentication and generating signatures — See Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.   Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See Identity and Access Management on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide.    Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names in the AWS General Reference.  Channel Endpoints     CreateChannel — Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming.    GetChannel — Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN.    BatchGetChannel — Performs GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously.    ListChannels — Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 Conflict Exception).    UpdateChannel — Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect.    DeleteChannel — Deletes the specified channel.    Playback Restriction Policy Endpoints     CreatePlaybackRestrictionPolicy — Creates a new playback restriction policy, for constraining playback by countries and/or origins.    DeletePlaybackRestrictionPolicy — Deletes the specified playback restriction policy    GetPlaybackRestrictionPolicy — Gets the specified playback restriction policy.    ListPlaybackRestrictionPolicies — Gets summary information about playback restriction policies.    UpdatePlaybackRestrictionPolicy — Updates a specified playback restriction policy.    Private Channel Endpoints  For more information, see Setting Up Private Channels in the Amazon IVS User Guide.    ImportPlaybackKeyPair — Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its arn and fingerprint. The privateKey can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization).    GetPlaybackKeyPair — Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the arn and fingerprint. The privateKey held by the caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels.    ListPlaybackKeyPairs — Gets summary information about playback key pairs.    DeletePlaybackKeyPair — Deletes a specified authorization key pair. This invalidates future viewer tokens generated using the key pair’s privateKey.    StartViewerSessionRevocation — Starts the process of revoking the viewer session associated with a specified channel ARN and viewer ID. Optionally, you can provide a version to revoke viewer sessions less than and including that version.    BatchStartViewerSessionRevocation — Performs StartViewerSessionRevocation on multiple channel ARN and viewer ID pairs simultaneously.    RecordingConfiguration Endpoints     CreateRecordingConfiguration — Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3.    GetRecordingConfiguration — Gets the recording-configuration metadata for the specified ARN.    ListRecordingConfigurations — Gets summary information about all recording configurations in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed.    DeleteRecordingConfiguration — Deletes the recording configuration for the specified ARN.    Stream Endpoints     GetStream — Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel.    GetStreamSession — Gets metadata on a specified stream.    ListStreams — Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the Amazon Web Services region where the API request is processed.    ListStreamSessions — Gets a summary of current and previous streams for a specified channel in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed.    StopStream — Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with DeleteStreamKey to prevent further streaming to a channel.    PutMetadata — Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified channel. At most 5 requests per second per channel are allowed, each with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is not sufficient for your needs, we recommend batching your data into a single PutMetadata call.) At most 155 requests per second per account are allowed.    StreamKey Endpoints     CreateStreamKey — Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN.    GetStreamKey — Gets stream key information for the specified ARN.    BatchGetStreamKey — Performs GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultaneously.    ListStreamKeys — Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel.    DeleteStreamKey — Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream.    Amazon Web Services Tags Endpoints     TagResource — Adds or updates tags for the Amazon Web Services resource with the specified ARN.    UntagResource — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.    ListTagsForResource — Gets information about Amazon Web Services tags for the specified ARN.  ",

"name": "Amazon IVS Chat",
"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": " Introduction  The Amazon IVS Chat control-plane API enables you to create and manage Amazon IVS Chat resources. You also need to integrate with the  Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API, to enable users to interact with chat rooms in real time. The API is an AWS regional service. For a list of supported regions and Amazon IVS Chat HTTPS service endpoints, see the Amazon IVS Chat information on the Amazon IVS page in the AWS General Reference.   Notes on terminology:    You create service applications using the Amazon IVS Chat API. We refer to these as applications.   You create front-end client applications (browser and Android/iOS apps) using the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API. We refer to these as clients.     Resources  The following resources are part of Amazon IVS Chat:    LoggingConfiguration — A configuration that allows customers to store and record sent messages in a chat room. See the Logging Configuration endpoints for more information.    Room — The central Amazon IVS Chat resource through which clients connect to and exchange chat messages. See the Room endpoints for more information.    Tagging  A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags and Tag naming limits and requirements; Amazon IVS Chat has no service-specific constraints beyond what is documented there. Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see Access Tags). The Amazon IVS Chat API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resource supports tagging: Room. At most 50 tags can be applied to a resource.  API Access Security  Your Amazon IVS Chat applications (service applications and clients) must be authenticated and authorized to access Amazon IVS Chat resources. Note the differences between these concepts:    Authentication is about verifying identity. Requests to the Amazon IVS Chat API must be signed to verify your identity.    Authorization is about granting permissions. Your IAM roles need to have permissions for Amazon IVS Chat API requests.   Users (viewers) connect to a room using secure access tokens that you create using the CreateChatToken endpoint through the AWS SDK. You call CreateChatToken for every user’s chat session, passing identity and authorization information about the user.  Signing API Requests  HTTP API requests must be signed with an AWS SigV4 signature using your AWS security credentials. The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and the AWS SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS Chat HTTP API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests. You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials for an IAM role that has permission to perform the requested action. For example, DeleteMessage requests must be made using an IAM role that has the ivschat:DeleteMessage permission. For more information:   Authentication and generating signatures — See Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.   Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See Identity and Access Management on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide.    Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  ARNs uniquely identify AWS resources. An ARN is required when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of AWS, such as in IAM policies and API calls. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names in the AWS General Reference.  Messaging Endpoints     DeleteMessage — Sends an event to a specific room which directs clients to delete a specific message; that is, unrender it from view and delete it from the client’s chat history. This event’s EventName is aws:DELETE_MESSAGE. This replicates the  DeleteMessage WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.    DisconnectUser — Disconnects all connections using a specified user ID from a room. This replicates the  DisconnectUser WebSocket operation in the Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API.    SendEvent — Sends an event to a room. Use this within your application’s business logic to send events to clients of a room; e.g., to notify clients to change the way the chat UI is rendered.    Chat Token Endpoint     CreateChatToken — Creates an encrypted token that is used by a chat participant to establish an individual WebSocket chat connection to a room. When the token is used to connect to chat, the connection is valid for the session duration specified in the request. The token becomes invalid at the token-expiration timestamp included in the response.    Room Endpoints     CreateRoom — Creates a room that allows clients to connect and pass messages.    DeleteRoom — Deletes the specified room.    GetRoom — Gets the specified room.    ListRooms — Gets summary information about all your rooms in the AWS region where the API request is processed.     UpdateRoom — Updates a room’s configuration.    Logging Configuration Endpoints     CreateLoggingConfiguration — Creates a logging configuration that allows clients to store and record sent messages.    DeleteLoggingConfiguration — Deletes the specified logging configuration.    GetLoggingConfiguration — Gets the specified logging configuration.    ListLoggingConfigurations — Gets summary information about all your logging configurations in the AWS region where the API request is processed.    UpdateLoggingConfiguration — Updates a specified logging configuration.    Tags Endpoints     ListTagsForResource — Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.    TagResource — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN.    UntagResource — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN.   All the above are HTTP operations. There is a separate messaging API for managing Chat resources; see the  Amazon IVS Chat Messaging API Reference.",

"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": "Key Management Service Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the  Key Management Service Developer Guide .  KMS has replaced the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term. Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS. If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use the FIPS endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information about the available FIPS endpoints, see Service endpoints in the Key Management Service topic of the Amazon Web Services General Reference. All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests.  All KMS requests must be signed with Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    Amazon Web Services Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used API Operations  Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.

"description": "This is the API Reference for Network Firewall. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Network Firewall API actions, data types, and errors.    The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information about using the Amazon Web Services REST APIs, see Amazon Web Services APIs.  To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: https://network-firewall.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com     Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs.   For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the Network Firewall Developer Guide.   Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source network analysis and threat detection engine. Network Firewall supports Suricata version 6.0.9. For information about Suricata, see the Suricata website. You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples:    Allow domains or IP addresses for known Amazon Web Services service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic.   Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access.   Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC.   Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used.   To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see Amazon VPC User Guide. To start using Network Firewall, do the following:    (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC.    In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall.    In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior.    In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy.   In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.  ",

"name": "AWS OpsWorks CM",

"description": "AWS OpsWorks CM AWS OpsWorks for configuration management (CM) is a service that runs and manages configuration management servers. You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage.  Glossary of terms     Server: A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted.    Engine: The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet.    Backup: This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts.    Events: Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted.    Account attributes: Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account.     Endpoints  AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created.   opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com   opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com   For more information, see AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.

The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can use the Amazon Web Services CLI to access an API. For more information, see the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface User Guide. The Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments. Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations. When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on Proton, developers need permissions to the service create, list, update and delete API operations and the service instance list and update API operations. To learn more about Proton, see the Proton User Guide.  Ensuring Idempotency  When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.  Idempotency ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status. The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.  Idempotent create APIs with a client token  The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a client token. The corresponding Amazon Web Services CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you don't reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs. Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response. If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created. If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created. Idempotent create APIs with a client token:   CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion   CreateServiceTemplateVersion   CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection    Idempotent create APIs  Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource hasn't been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response. If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a ConflictException. If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Idempotent create APIs:   CreateEnvironmentTemplate   CreateServiceTemplate   CreateEnvironment   CreateService    Idempotent delete APIs  Given a request action that has succeeded: When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response. If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty. In both cases, the retry succeeds. Idempotent delete APIs:   DeleteEnvironmentTemplate   DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion   DeleteServiceTemplate   DeleteServiceTemplateVersion   DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection    Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs  Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is DELETE_IN_PROGRESS, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions. If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response. Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs:   DeleteEnvironment   DeleteService  ",

The guide provides detailed information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors. When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for Amazon Web Services service-vended monitoring metrics. Performance Insights offers a domain-specific view of DB load. DB load is measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.   To learn more about Performance Insights and Amazon Aurora DB instances, go to the   Amazon Aurora User Guide .

"description": "Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. With Route 53 ARC, you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover applications by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a highly available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another.   Be aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter --region us-west-2 with AWS CLI commands. For more information, see  Get and update routing control states using the API in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide. This API guide includes information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters, control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.

You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:  Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver  DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.  Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network  You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional.

You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. Security Lake helps you analyze security data for a more complete understanding of your security posture across the entire organization. It can also help you improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data. The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you retain ownership over your data. Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web Services service. In Security Lake, CloudTrail captures API calls for Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls from the Security Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made to Security Lake, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security Lake information in CloudTrail, see the Amazon Security Lake User Guide. Security Lake automates the collection of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon Web Services and third-party services. It also helps you manage the lifecycle of data with customizable retention and replication settings. Security Lake converts ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).

Security Hub collects security data across Amazon Web Services accounts, Amazon Web Services, and supported third-party products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues. To help you manage the security state of your organization, Security Hub supports multiple security standards. These include the Amazon Web Services Foundational Security Best Practices (FSBP) standard developed by Amazon Web Services, and external compliance frameworks such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Each standard includes several security controls, each of which represents a security best practice. Security Hub runs checks against security controls and generates control findings to help you assess your compliance against security best practices. In addition to generating control findings, Security Hub also receives findings from other Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon GuardDuty and Amazon Inspector, and supported third-party products. This gives you a single pane of glass into a variety of security-related issues. You can also send Security Hub findings to other Amazon Web Services and supported third-party products. Security Hub offers automation features that help you triage and remediate security issues. For example, you can use automation rules to automatically update critical findings when a security check fails. You can also leverage the integration with Amazon EventBridge to trigger automatic responses to specific findings. This guide, the Security Hub API Reference, provides information about the Security Hub API. This includes supported resources, HTTP methods, parameters, and schemas. If you're new to Security Hub, you might find it helpful to also review the  Security Hub User Guide . The user guide explains key concepts and provides procedures that demonstrate how to use Security Hub features. It also provides information about topics such as integrating Security Hub with other Amazon Web Services. In addition to interacting with Security Hub by making calls to the Security Hub API, you can use a current version of an Amazon Web Services command line tool or SDK. Amazon Web Services provides tools and SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various languages and platforms, such as PowerShell, Java, Go, Python, C++, and .NET. These tools and SDKs provide convenient, programmatic access to Security Hub and other Amazon Web Services . They also handle tasks such as signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about installing and using the Amazon Web Services tools and SDKs, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services. With the exception of operations that are related to central configuration, Security Hub API requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, call the same API operation in each Region in which you want to apply the change. When you use central configuration, API requests for enabling Security Hub, standards, and controls are executed in the home Region and all linked Regions. For a list of central configuration operations, see the Central configuration terms and concepts section of the Security Hub User Guide. The following throttling limits apply to Security Hub API operations.    BatchEnableStandards - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 1 request per second.    GetFindings - RateLimit of 3 requests per second. BurstLimit of 6 requests per second.    BatchImportFindings - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second.

The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery. Use the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API Reference:    Storage Gateway required request headers: Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to Storage Gateway.    Signing requests: Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.    Error responses: Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors.    Operations in Storage Gateway: Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.    Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas: Provides a list of each Amazon Web Services Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage Gateway.    Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.   IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs. For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:  arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG.

"description": "Amazon Verified Permissions is a permissions management service from Amazon Web Services. You can use Verified Permissions to manage permissions for your application, and authorize user access based on those permissions. Using Verified Permissions, application developers can grant access based on information about the users, resources, and requested actions. You can also evaluate additional information like group membership, attributes of the resources, and session context, such as time of request and IP addresses. Verified Permissions manages these permissions by letting you create and store authorization policies for your applications, such as consumer-facing web sites and enterprise business systems. Verified Permissions uses Cedar as the policy language to express your permission requirements. Cedar supports both role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) authorization models. For more information about configuring, administering, and using Amazon Verified Permissions in your applications, see the Amazon Verified Permissions User Guide. For more information about the Cedar policy language, see the Cedar Policy Language Guide.  When you write Cedar policies that reference principals, resources and actions, you can define the unique identifiers used for each of those elements. We strongly recommend that you follow these best practices:    Use values like universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for all principal and resource identifiers.  For example, if user jane leaves the company, and you later let someone else use the name jane, then that new user automatically gets access to everything granted by policies that still reference User::jane. Cedar can’t distinguish between the new user and the old. This applies to both principal and resource identifiers. Always use identifiers that are guaranteed unique and never reused to ensure that you don’t unintentionally grant access because of the presence of an old identifier in a policy. Where you use a UUID for an entity, we recommend that you follow it with the // comment specifier and the ‘friendly’ name of your entity. This helps to make your policies easier to understand. For example: principal == User::a1b2c3d4-e5f6-a1b2-c3d4-EXAMPLE11111, // alice    Do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information as part of the unique identifier for your principals or resources. These identifiers are included in log entries shared in CloudTrail trails.    Several operations return structures that appear similar, but have different purposes. As new functionality is added to the product, the structure used in a parameter of one operation might need to change in a way that wouldn't make sense for the same parameter in a different operation. To help you understand the purpose of each, the following naming convention is used for the structures:   Parameter type structures that end in Detail are used in Get operations.   Parameter type structures that end in Item are used in List operations.   Parameter type structures that use neither suffix are used in the mutating (create and update) operations.  ",

"description": "WAF  This is the latest version of the WAF API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like V2 or v2, to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.  For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide.   WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service, or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content, an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response.  This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quotas.    For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance.    For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.   Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs. We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements:   You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.    You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls.   The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.  ",

"name": "Amazon WorkDocs",
"slug": "amazon-web-services",
"description": "The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:   File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of files.   Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the user.   eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with CloudTrail, to replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.   All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the use of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.  The pricing for Amazon WorkDocs APIs varies depending on the API call type for these actions:    READ (Get*)     WRITE (Activate*, Add*, Create*, Deactivate*, Initiate*, Update*)     LIST (Describe*)     DELETE*, CANCEL    For information about Amazon WorkDocs API pricing, see Amazon WorkDocs Pricing.
