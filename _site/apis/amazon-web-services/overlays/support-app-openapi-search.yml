        <p>Creates a Slack channel configuration for your Amazon Web Services
        account.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>You can add up to 5 Slack workspaces
        for your account.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can add up to 20 Slack channels
        for your account.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>A Slack channel can have up
        to 100 Amazon Web Services accounts. This means that only 100 accounts
        can add the same Slack channel to the Amazon Web Services Support App.
        We recommend that you only add the accounts that you need to manage
        support cases for your organization. This can reduce the notifications
        about case updates that you receive in the Slack channel.</p> <note>
        <p>We recommend that you choose a private Slack channel so that only
        members in that channel have read and write access to your support
        cases. Anyone in your Slack channel can create, update, or resolve
        support cases for your account. Users require an invitation to join
        private channels. </p> </note>

        <p>Registers a Slack workspace for your Amazon Web Services account. To
