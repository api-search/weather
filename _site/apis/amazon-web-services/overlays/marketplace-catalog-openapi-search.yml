        <p>Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single
        <code>ChangeSet</code>, you can't start the same change type against the
        same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a <code>ChangeSet</code>
        is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are
        locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled,
        or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against
        an entity that is already locked, you will receive a
        <code>ResourceInUseException</code> error.</p> <p>For example, you can't
        start the <code>ChangeSet</code> described in the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples">example</a>
        later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same
        change type (<code>AddRevisions</code>) against the same entity
        (<code>entity-id@1</code>).</p> <p>For more information about working
