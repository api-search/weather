      summary: UploadLayerPart
      description: >-
        <p>Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.</p> <p>When an image is
        pushed, each new image layer is uploaded in parts. The maximum size of
        each image layer part can be 20971520 bytes (about 20MB). The
        UploadLayerPart API is called once for each new image layer part.</p>
        <note> <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not
        generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most
        cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push
        images.</
