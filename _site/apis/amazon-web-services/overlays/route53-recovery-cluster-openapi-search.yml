      summary: UpdateRoutingControlStates
      description: >-
        <p>Set multiple routing control states. You can set the value for each
        state to be ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell.
        When it's OFF, traffic does not flow.</p> <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can
        add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards for routing
        control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail
        open traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might want
        to bypass the routing control safeguards that are enforced with safety
        rules that you've configured. For example, you might want to fail over
        quickly for disaster recovery, and one or more safety rules might be
        unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to
        reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override
        one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over
        your application.</p> <p>The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property
        enables you override one or more safety rules and update routing control
        states. For more information, see <a
