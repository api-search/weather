      description: >-
        <p>The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline,
        so that the pipeline stops or restarts the processing of jobs.</p>
        <p>Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want to cancel one or
        more jobs. You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started
        processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you submitted the
        jobs, you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want
        to cancel, and to send a <a>CancelJob</a> req
