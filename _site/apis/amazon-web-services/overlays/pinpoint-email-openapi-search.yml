        <p>Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox
        placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled
        by various email providers around the world. When you perform a
        predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that
        contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon
        Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread
        across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is
        complete, and you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code>
        operation to view the results of the test.</p>
