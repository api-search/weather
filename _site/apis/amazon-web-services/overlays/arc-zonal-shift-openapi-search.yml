      description: >-
        <p>A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you
        enable zonal autoshift. A practice run configuration includes
        specifications for blocked dates and blocked time windows, and for
        Amazon CloudWatch alarms that you create to use with practice runs. The
        alarms that you specify are an <i>outcome alarm</i>, to monitor
        application health during practice runs and, optionally, a <i>blocking
        alarm</i>, to block practice runs from starting.</p> <p>For more

      summary: StartZonalShift
      description: >-
        <p>You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic
        away from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help
        your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's
        bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure
        failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in
        Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services
        account in an Amazon Web Services Region. Resources are automatically
        registered with Route 53 ARC by Amazon Web Services services.</p> <p>At
        this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers
        and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned
        off.</p> <p>When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no
        longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created
        immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short time,
        typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in
        the Availability Zone to complete.</p> <p>For more information, see <a
