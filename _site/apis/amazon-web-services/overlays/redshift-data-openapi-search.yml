      summary: ListTables
      description: >-
        <p>List the tables in a database. If neither <code>SchemaPattern</code>
        nor <code>TablePattern</code> are specified, then all tables in the
        database are returned. A token is returned to page through the table
        list. Depending on the authorization method, use one of the following
        combinations of request parameters: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Secrets Manager -
        when connecting to a cluster, provide the <code>secret-arn</code> of a
        secret stored in Secrets Manager which has <code>username</code> and
        <code>password</code>. The specified secret contains credentials to
        connect to the <code>database</code> you specify. When you are
        connecting to a cluster, you also supply the database name, If you
        provide a cluster identifier (<code>dbClusterIdentifier</code>), it must
        match the cluster identifier stored in the secret. When you are
        connecting to a serverless workgroup, you also supply the database
        name.</p> </li> <li> <p>Temporary credentials - when connecting to your
        data warehouse, choose one of the following options:</p> <ul> <li>
        <p>When connecting to a serverless workgroup, specify the workgroup name
        and database name. The database user name is derived from the IAM
        identity. For example, <code>arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo</code> has
        the database user name <code>IAM:foo</code>. Also, permission to call
        the <code>redshift-serverless:GetCredentials</code> operation is
        required.</p> </li> <li> <p>When connecting to a cluster as an IAM
        identity, specify the cluster identifier and the database name. The
        database user name is derived from the IAM identity. For example,
        <code>arn:iam::123456789012:user:foo</code> has the database user name
        <code>IAM:foo</code>. Also, permission to call the
        <code>redshift:GetClusterCredentialsWithIAM</code> operation is
        required.</p> </li> <li> <p>When connecting to a cluster as a database
        user, specify the cluster identifier, the database name, and the
        database user name. Also, permission to call the
        <code>redshift:GetClusterCredentials</code> operation is required.</p>
