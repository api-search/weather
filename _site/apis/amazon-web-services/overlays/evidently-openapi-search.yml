        <p>This operation assigns feature variation to user sessions. For each
        user session, you pass in an <code>entityID</code> that represents the
        user. Evidently then checks the evaluation rules and assigns the
        variation.</p> <p>The first rules that are evaluated are the override
        rules. If the user's <code>entityID</code> matches an override rule, the
        user is served the variation specified by that rule.</p> <p>Next, if
        there is a launch of the feature, the user might be assigned to a
        variation in the launch. The chance of this depends on the percentage of
        users that are allocated to that launch. If the user is enrolled in the
        launch, the variation they are served depends on the allocation of the
        various feature variations used for the launch.</p> <p>If the user is
        not assigned to a launch, and there is an ongoing experiment for this
        feature, the user might be assigned to a variation in the experiment.
        The chance of this depends on the percentage of users that are allocated
        to that experiment. If the user is enrolled in the experiment, the
        variation they are served depends on the allocation of the various
        feature variations used for the experiment. </p> <p>If the user is not
        assigned to a launch or experiment, they are served the default
        variation.</p>
