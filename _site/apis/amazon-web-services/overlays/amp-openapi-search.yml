  /workspaces/{workspaceId}/rulegroupsnamespaces/{name}:
    PUT:
      summary: Put Rule Groups Namespace
      description: >-
        This API enables users to modify an existing rule groups namespace
        within a workspace. Each rule groups namespace is associated with a
        single rules file, and a workspace can contain several rule groups
        namespaces. This functionality is specifically designed for updating
        existing rule groups namespaces. For creating a new rule groups
        namespace, users should utilize the CreateRuleGroupsNamespace function.
        It is important to note that adding tags to an existing rule groups
        namespace is not supported by this operation; instead, users should use
        the TagResource function for this purpose.
