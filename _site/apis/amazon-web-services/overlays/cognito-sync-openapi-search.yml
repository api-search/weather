      summary: 'Bulk Publish '
      description: >-
        <p>Initiates a bulk publish of all existing datasets for an Identity
        Pool to the configured stream. Customers are limited to one successful
        bulk publish per 24 hours. Bulk publish is an asynchronous request,
        customers can see the status of the request via the
        GetBulkPublishDetails operation.</p><p>This API can only be called with

      summary: 'Update Records '
      description: >-
        <p>Posts updates to records and adds and deletes records for a dataset
        and user.</p> <p>The sync count in the record patch is your last known
        sync count for that record. The server will reject an UpdateRecords
        request with a ResourceConflictException if you try to patch a record
        with a new value but a stale sync count.</p><p>For example, if the sync
        count on the server is 5 for a key called highScore and you try and
        submit a new highScore with sync count of 4, the request will be
        rejected. To obtain the current sync count for a record, call
        ListRecords. On a successful update of the record, the response returns
        the new sync count for that record. You should present that sync count
        the next time you try to update that same record. When the record does
        not exist, specify the sync count as 0.</p> <p>This API can be called
