      description: >-
        <p>Updates a monitor. You can update a monitor to change the percentage
        of traffic to monitor or the maximum number of city-networks (locations
        and ASNs), to add or remove resources, or to change the status of the
        monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor.</p> <p>The
        city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay for
        the number of city-networks that are actually monitored. For more
        information, see <a
