      description: >-
        <p>Updates the specified <a>WebACL</a>. While updating a web ACL, WAF
        provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated
        with the web ACL. </p> <note> <p>This operation completely replaces the
        mutable specifications that you already have for the web ACL with the
        ones that you provide to this call. </p> <p>To modify a web ACL, do the
        following: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Retrieve it by calling <a>GetWebACL</a>
        </p> </li> <li> <p>Update its settings as needed</p> </li> <li>
        <p>Provide the complete web ACL specification to this call</p> </li>
        </ol> </note> <p> A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to
        inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines
        what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to
        requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default
        action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of
        the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types
        <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate
        a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The
        resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API
        Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API,
        an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web
        Services Verified Access instance. </p> <p> <b>Temporary inconsistencies
        during updates</b> </p> <p>When you create or change a web ACL or other
        WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to
        all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be
        from a few seconds to a number of minutes. </p> <p>The following are
        examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during
        change propagation: </p> <ul> <li> <p>After you create a web ACL, if you
        try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception
        indicating that the web ACL is unavailable. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you
        add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in
        effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.</p>
        </li> <li> <p>After you change a rule action setting, you might see the
        old action in some places and the new action in others. </p> </li> <li>
        <p>After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking
        rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed
        in another.</p> <
