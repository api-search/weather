      summary: Put Resource Attributes
      description: >-
        <p>Provides identifying details of the resource being migrated so that
        it can be associated in the Application Discovery Service repository.
        This association occurs asynchronously after
        <code>PutResourceAttributes</code> returns.</p> <important> <ul> <li>
        <p>Keep in mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will
        override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first
        called with a MAC address, but later, it is desired to <i>add</i> an IP
        address, it will then be required to call it with <i>both</i> the IP and
        MAC addresses to prevent overriding the MAC address.</p> </li> <li>
        <p>Note the instructions regarding the special use case of the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#migrationhub-PutResourceAttributes-request-ResourceAttributeList">
        <code>ResourceAttributeList</code> </a> parameter when specifying any
        "VM" related value.</p> </li> </ul> </important> <note> <p>Because this
        is an asynchronous call, it will always return 200, whether an
        association occurs or not. To confirm if an association was found based
        on the provided details, call <code>ListDiscoveredResources</code>.</
