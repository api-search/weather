      description: >-
        <p>Updates the specified policy template. You can update only the
        description and the some elements of the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/apireference/API_UpdatePolicyTemplate.html#amazonverifiedpermissions-UpdatePolicyTemplate-request-policyBody">policyBody</a>.
        </p> <important> <p>Changes you make to the policy template content are
        immediately (within the constraints of eventual consistency) reflected
        in authorization decisions that involve all template-linked policies
        instantiated from this template.</p> </important> <note> <p>Verified
        Permissions is <i> <a
        href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventually
        consistent</a> </i>. It can take a few seconds for a new or changed
        element to be propagate through the service and be visible in the
        results of other Verified Permissions operations.</
