      summary: ValidateResourcePolicy
      description: >-
        <p>Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of
        principals access to your secret. A resource-based policy is optional
        for secrets.</p> <p>The API performs three checks when validating the
        policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sends a call to <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/">Zelkova</a>,
        an automated reasoning engine, to ensure your resource policy does not
        allow broad access to your secret, for example policies that use a
        wildcard for the principal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Checks for correct syntax
        in a policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verifies the policy does not lock out a
        caller.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log
        entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in
        request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see
