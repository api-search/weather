        <p>Adds a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security
        Lake source. Enables source types for member accounts in required Amazon
        Web Services Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can
        choose any source type in any Region for either accounts that are part
        of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an Amazon
        Web Service as a source, Security Lake starts collecting logs and events
        from it.</p> <p>You can use this API only to enable natively supported
        Amazon Web Services as a source. Use <code>CreateCustomLogSource</code>
        to enable data collection from a custom source.</p>

      description: >-
        <p>Adds a third-party custom source in Amazon Security Lake, from the
        Amazon Web Services Region where you want to create a custom source.
        Security Lake can collect logs and events from third-party custom
        sources. After creating the appropriate IAM role to invoke Glue crawler,
        use this API to add a custom source name in Security Lake. This
        operation creates a partition in the Amazon S3 bucket for Security Lake
        as the target location for log files from the custom source. In
        addition, this operation also creates an associated Glue table and an
        Glue crawler.</p>
