      summary: UpdateTimeToLive
      description: >-
        <p>The <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code> method enables or disables Time to
        Live (TTL) for the specified table. A successful
        <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code> call returns the current
        <code>TimeToLiveSpecification</code>. It can take up to one hour for the
        change to fully process. Any additional <code>UpdateTimeToLive</code>
        calls for the same table during this one hour duration result in a
        <code>ValidationException</code>. </p> <p>TTL compares the current time
        in epoch time format to the time stored in the TTL attribute of an item.
        If the epoch time value stored in the attribute is less than the current
        time, the item is marked as expired and subsequently deleted.</p> <note>
        <p> The epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed since
        12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC. </p> </note> <p>DynamoDB deletes
        expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure availability of
        throughput for other data operations. </p> <important> <p>DynamoDB
        typically deletes expired items within two days of expiration. The exact
        duration within which an item gets deleted after expiration is specific
        to the nature of the workload. Items that have expired and not been
        deleted will still show up in reads, queries, and scans.</p>
        </important> <p>As items are deleted, they are removed from any local
        secondary index and global secondary index immediately in the same
        eventually consistent way as a standard delete operation.</p> <p>For
