        <p>Verifies a destination phone number with a one-time password (OTP)
        for the calling Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>When you start using
        Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in
        the <i>SMS sandbox</i>. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for
        you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS
        sender. While your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox,
        you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS
        messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more
        information, including how to move out of the sandbox to send messages
        without restrictions, see <a
