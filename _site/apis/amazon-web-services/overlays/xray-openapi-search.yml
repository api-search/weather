        <p>Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented

        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html">GetSamplingRules</a>,
        and evaluate each rule in ascending order of <i>priority</i> for each
        request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it
        from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to
        X-Ray with <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html">GetSamplingTargets</a>
        to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a
        trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the
        reservoir.</p>

        <p>Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. The <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html">X-Ray SDK</a>
        generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which
        uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment,
        an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.</p> <p>Segments must
        include the following fields. For the full segment document schema, see
        <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html">Amazon
        Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services
        X-Ray Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p class="title"> <b>Required segment
        document fields</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>name</code> - The name of
        the service that handled the request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code>
        - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same
        trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>trace_id</code> - A unique identifier that connects all segments
        and subsegments originating from a single client request.</p> </li> <li>
        <p> <code>start_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was
        created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to
        milliseconds. For example, <code>1480615200.010</code> or
        <code>1.480615200010E9</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>end_time</code>
        - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example,
        <code>1480615200.090</code> or <code>1.480615200090E9</code>. Specify
        either an <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code> instead of
        specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that a segment has been
        started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your
        application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to
        trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the
        complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.</p> </li> </ul>
        <p>A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated by
        hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This
        includes:</p> <p class="title"> <b>Trace ID Format</b> </p> <ul> <li>
        <p>The version number, for instance, <code>1</code>.</p> </li> <li>
        <p>The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8
        hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch
        time is <code>1480615200</code> seconds, or <code>58406520</code> in
        hexadecimal.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 96-bit identifier for the trace,
        globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> </ul>
