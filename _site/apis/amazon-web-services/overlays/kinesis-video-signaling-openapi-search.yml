        <p>Gets the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) server
        configuration information, including URIs, username, and password which
        can be used to configure the WebRTC connection. The ICE component uses
        this configuration information to setup the WebRTC connection, including
        authenticating with the Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) relay
        server. </p> <p>TURN is a protocol that is used to improve the
        connectivity of peer-to-peer applications. By providing a cloud-based
        relay service, TURN ensures that a connection can be established even
        when one or more peers are incapable of a direct peer-to-peer
        connection. For more information, see <a
        href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-rtcweb-turn-rest-00">A
        REST API For Access To TURN Services</a>.</p> <p> You can invoke this
        API to establish a fallback mechanism in case either of the peers is
        unable to establish a direct peer-to-peer connection over a signaling
        channel. You must specify either a signaling channel ARN or the client
        ID in order to invoke this API.</p>

        <p>This API allows you to connect WebRTC-enabled devices with Alexa
        display devices. When invoked, it sends the Alexa Session Description
        Protocol (SDP) offer to the master peer. The offer is delivered as soon
        as the master is connected to the specified signaling channel. This API
        returns the SDP answer from the connected master. If the master is not
        connected to the signaling channel, redelivery requests are made until
