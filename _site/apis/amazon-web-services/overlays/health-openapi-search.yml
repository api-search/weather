      description: >-
        <p>Enables Health to work with Organizations. You can use the
        organizational view feature to aggregate events from all Amazon Web
        Services accounts in your organization in a centralized location. </p>
        <p>This operation also creates a service-linked role for the management
        account in the organization. </p> <note> <p>To call this operation, you
        must meet the following requirements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You must have a
        Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a
        href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services
        Support</a> to use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an
        Amazon Web Services account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise
        On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a
        <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p> </li> <li> <p>You
        must have permission to call this operation from the organization's
        management account. For example IAM policies, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html">Health
        identity-based policy examples</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </note> <p>If you
        don't have the required support plan, you can instead use the Health
        console to enable the organizational view feature. For more information,
        see <a
