        For this operation, the key must have <code>KeyModesOfUse</code> set to

        Payment Cryptography decrypts the ciphertext using the private component

        Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can export the public

        <p>For symmetric and DUKPT decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment
        Cryptography supports <code>TDES</code> and <code>AES</code> algorithms.
        For asymmetric decryption, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
        supports <code>RSA</code>. When you use DUKPT, for <code>TDES</code>
        algorithm, the ciphertext data length must be a multiple of 16 bytes.

        Number) and expiration date of the card to check its validity during
        transaction processing. In this operation, the CVK (Card Verification
        Key) encryption key for use with card data verification is same as the
        one in used for <a>GenerateCardValidationData</a>. </p> <p>For

        <p>Verifies a Message Authentication Code (MAC). </p> <p>You can use
        this operation when keys won't be shared but mutual data is present on
        both ends for validation. In this case, known data values are used to
        generate a MAC on both ends for verification without sending or
        receiving data in ciphertext or plaintext. You can use this operation to
        verify a DUPKT, HMAC or EMV MAC by setting generation attributes and
        algorithm to the associated values. Use the same encryption key for MAC
        verification as you use for <a>GenerateMac</a>. </p> <p>For information
