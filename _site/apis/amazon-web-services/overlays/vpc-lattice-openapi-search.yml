        identifier.</p> <p>Every association in Amazon VPC Lattice is given a
        unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN), such as when a service network is
        associated with a VPC or when a service is associated with a service
        network. If the association is for a resource that is shared with
        another account, the association will include the local account ID as
        the prefix in the ARN for each account the resource is shared with.</p>
