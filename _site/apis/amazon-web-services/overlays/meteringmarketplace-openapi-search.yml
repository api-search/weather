        <p> <code>ResolveCustomer</code> is called by a SaaS application during
        the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the
        registration process, the buyer submits a registration token through
        their browser. The registration token is resolved through this API to
        obtain a <code>CustomerIdentifier</code> along with the
        <code>CustomerAWSAccountId</code> and <code>ProductCode</code>.</p>
        <note> <p>The API needs to called from the seller account id used to
        publish the SaaS application to successfully resolve the token.</p>
