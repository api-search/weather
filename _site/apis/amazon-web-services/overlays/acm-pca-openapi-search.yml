      summary: Update Certificate Authority
      description: >-
        <p>Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate
        authority (CA). Your private CA must be in the <code>ACTIVE</code> or
        <code>DISABLED</code> state before you can update it. You can disable a
        private CA that is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state or make a CA that is
        in the <code>DISABLED</code> state active again.</p> <note> <p>Both
        Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have
        permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM
        principal making the call does not have permission to write to the
        bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see <a

        policies for CRLs in Amazon S3</a>.</
