      Batch Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
      Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers,
      scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources.
      Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove the
      undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
      infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch
      computing software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision
      resources d, and work toward eliminating capacity constraints, reducing
      your overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly. As a
      fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any
      scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes
      workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
      workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch
      computing software. This means that you can focus on analyzing results and
      solving your specific problems instead.

      The Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor API is a fully managed service
      that allows you to customize your billing data each month for accurate
      showback or chargeback to your end customers. It does not alter the way
      you are billed by AWS, but rather enables you to configure, generate, and
      display rates for specific customers during a billing period. You can also
      compare the rates you set to your actual AWS rates. With the API, payer
      accounts can view custom rates on the billing details page or set up cost
      and usage reports per billing group.

      datasets, with up to 20 datasets per user identity. Data stored with
      Amazon Cognito Sync is only accessible to the associated identity
      credentials. To use the Cognito Sync service, API calls must be made using
      credentials obtained from Amazon Cognito Identity service. For Android or
      iOS applications, developers can utilize the AWS Mobile SDK for API calls.
      For more information, refer to the Developer Guide for Android and the

      Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that provides scoped
      temporary credentials for mobile devices and other untrusted environments.
      It offers consistent identity management for users throughout the lifespan
      of an application. With Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, developers
      can enable authentication with third-party identity providers like
      Facebook, Google, or Amazon, as well as with an Amazon Cognito user pool.
      Unauthenticated access from an app is also supported. Cognito generates a
      unique identifier for each user and serves as an OpenID token provider
      that is trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary
      AWS credentials with limited privileges. For a detailed explanation of the
      authentication process, refer to the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide's
      Authentication Flow section. More information about Amazon Cognito
      Federated Identities can be found on the official documentation.

    description: >-
      These APIs allow you to programmatically apply a library of predefined
      controls from Amazon Web Services to your organizational units. In Amazon
      Web Services Control Tower, the terms "control" and "guardrail" are
      interchangeable. To make API calls, you will need to know the
      controlIdentifier for the specific control you are targeting, the ARN
      associated with the target organizational unit (OU), referred to as the
      targetIdentifier, and the ARN associated with a resource you want to tag
      or untag.


      To obtain the controlIdentifier for your Amazon Web Services Control Tower
      control, each control has a unique ARN specified. You can locate the
      controlIdentifier in the console on the Control details page or in the
      documentation. The controlIdentifier is specific to each Amazon Web
      Services Region for each control and can be found in the Tables of control
      metadata in the Amazon Web Services Control Tower User Guide.


      For the targetIdentifier, it is the ARN for an OU, which can be found in
      the Organizational unit details page in the Amazon Web Services
      Organizations console.


      For more information and examples, please refer to the following
      resources:

      - Control API input and output examples with CLI

      - Enabling controls with CloudFormation

      - Control metadata tables

      - List of identifiers for legacy controls

      - Controls reference guide

      - Controls library groupings

      - Creating Amazon Web Services Control Tower resources with Amazon Web
      Services CloudFormation


      To access the open-source resource repository on GitHub, visit
      aws-cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-resource-providers-controltower.


      Additionally, Amazon Web Services Control Tower supports Amazon Web
      Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls
      for your account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By
      utilizing CloudTrail, you can monitor requests received by the Amazon Web
      Services Control Tower service, including details on who made the request
      and when. For more information on CloudTrail and its integration with
      Amazon Web Services Control Tower, refer to the Amazon Web Services
      Control Tower User Guide and the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User

      AWS Data Exchange is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to
      exchange data in the cloud. You can use the AWS Data Exchange APIs to
      create, update, manage, and access file-based data set in the AWS Cloud.
      As a subscriber, you can view and access the data sets that you have an
      entitlement to through a subscription. You can use the APIs to download or
      copy your entitled data sets to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
      for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services.
      As a provider, you can create and manage your data sets that you would
      like to publish to a product. Being able to package and provide your data
      sets into products requires a few steps to determine eligibility. For more
      information, visit the AWS Data Exchange User Guide. A data set is a
      collection of data that can be changed or updated over time. Data sets can
      be updated using revisions, which represent a new version or incremental
      change to a data set. A revision contains one or more assets. An asset in
      AWS Data Exchange is a piece of data that can be stored as an Amazon S3
      object, Redshift datashare, API Gateway API, AWS Lake Formation data
      permission, or Amazon S3 data access. The asset can be a structured data
      file, an image file, or some other data file. Jobs are asynchronous import
      or export operations used to create or copy assets.

      performing database queries and running data analysis using Amazon Elastic
      MapReduce (Amazon EMR). You can use AWS Data Pipeline Task Runner as your
      task runner, or you can write your own task runner to provide custom data
      management. AWS Data Pipeline implements two main sets of functionality.
      Use the first set to create a pipeline and define data sources, schedules,
      dependencies, and the transforms to be performed on the data. Use the
      second set in your task runner application to receive the next task ready
      for processing. The logic for performing the task, such as querying the
      data, running data analysis, or converting the data from one format to
      another, is contained within the task runner. The task runner performs the
      task assigned to it by the web service, reporting progress to the web
      service as it does so. When the task is done, the task runner reports the
      final success or failure of the task to the web service.

    description: >-
      <fullname>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service</fullname>
      <p>Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service (Application
      Discovery Service) helps you plan application migration projects. It
      automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network
      dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see
      the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">Amazon Web
      Services Application Discovery Service FAQ</a>. </p> <p>Application
      Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting
      data about your on-premises servers:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Agentless
      discovery</b> using Amazon Web Services Application Discovery Service
      Agentless Collector (Agentless Collector), which doesn't require you to
      install an agent on each host.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Agentless Collector
      gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which
      minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
      assessment.</p> </li> <li> <p>Agentless Collector doesn't collect
      information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery
      collects that information. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>
      <b>Agent-based discovery</b> using the Amazon Web Services Application
      Discovery Agent (Application Discovery Agent) collects a richer set of
      data than agentless discovery, which you install on one or more hosts in
      your data center.</p> <ul> <li> <p> The agent captures infrastructure and
      application information, including an inventory of running processes,
      system performance information, resource utilization, and network
      dependencies.</p> </li> <li> <p>The information collected by agents is
      secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service
      database in the Amazon Web Services cloud. For more information, see <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/discovery-agent.html">Amazon
      Web Services Application Discovery Agent</a>.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>
      <ul> <li> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Partner Network (APN) solutions</b>
      integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import
      details of your on-premises environment directly into Amazon Web Services
      Migration Hub (Migration Hub) without using Agentless Collector or
      Application Discovery Agent.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Third-party application
      discovery tools can query Amazon Web Services Application Discovery
      Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database
      using the public API.</p> </li> <li> <p>In this way, you can import data
      into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications
      with servers and track migrations.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>
      <b>Working With This Guide</b> </p> <p>This API reference provides
      descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data
      types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows
      the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use
      one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that is tailored to
      the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
      information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web
      Services SDKs</a>.</p> <note> <ul> <li> <p>Remember that you must set your
      Migration Hub home Region before you call any of these APIs.</p> </li>
      <li> <p>You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify,
      associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home Region, or a
      <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is returned.</p> </li> <li>
      <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are
      permitted outside of your home Region.</p> </li> <li> <p>Although it is
      unlikely, the Migration Hub home Region could change. If you call APIs
      outside the home Region, an <code>InvalidInputException</code> is
      returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> to
      obtain the latest Migration Hub home Region.</p> </li> </ul> </note>
      <p>This guide is intended for use with the <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/">Amazon
      Web Services Application Discovery Service User Guide</a>.</p> <important>
      <p>All data is handled according to the <a
      href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">Amazon Web Services Privacy
      Policy</a>. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to
      inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.</p>

      Use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to easily
      create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
      data on your snapshots, and identify differences or changes between two
      snapshots. Independent software vendors (ISVs) offering backup services
      for Amazon EBS can benefit from the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of
      tracking incremental changes on Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots using
      these APIs. By creating incremental snapshots directly from on-premises
      data into volumes and the cloud, you can quickly enable disaster recovery.
      The ability to write and read snapshots allows you to write your
      on-premises data to a snapshot during a disaster and restore it back to
      Amazon Web Services or on-premises after recovery without the need for
      complex mechanisms.

  - name: AWS Elastic Load Balancing
    description: >-
      Elastic Load Balancing is a feature that allows you to distribute incoming
      traffic across your EC2 instances, increasing the availability of your
      application. The load balancer monitors the health of registered instances
      and ensures that traffic is only routed to healthy instances. You can
      configure your load balancer by specifying listeners that determine how
      traffic is accepted, including protocols and port numbers. Elastic Load
      Balancing offers three types of load balancers - Application Load
      Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers - so you can
      choose the one that best suits your application needs. For more
      information, please refer to the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide. The
      API documentation covers the 2012-06-01 API for Classic Load Balancers,
      while the 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network
      Load Balancers. To begin using Elastic Load Balancing, create a load
      balancer with listeners using CreateLoadBalancer and register your
      instances using RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer. All operations in
      Elastic Load Balancing are idempotent, meaning they only complete once and
      will succeed if repeated with a 200 OK response code.

    description: >-
      The Health API grants access to Health information displayed in the Health
      Dashboard. Users can utilize API operations to retrieve data on events
      that may impact their Amazon Web Services and resources. A Business,
      Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from Amazon Web Services
      Support is required to access the Health API. Attempting to use the API
      without the appropriate plan will result in a
      SubscriptionRequiredException error. Access to the API necessitates an
      access key ID and secret access key, with a recommendation to utilize
      temporary credentials over long-term access keys when feasible. Temporary
      credentials encompass an access key ID, secret access key, and security
      token indicating expiration. The Health API endpoint
      health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) can be accessed to call API
      operations. Health supports a multi-Region application architecture with
      two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. The high
      availability endpoint example can be utilized to identify the active
      Amazon Web Services Region for obtaining the most current information.
      Authentication for requests is carried out using the Signature Version 4
      Signing Process. Users with accounts under Organizations can leverage the
      Health organizational view feature for a centralized view of Health events
      across all accounts in the organization. This allows for real-time
      aggregation of events to identify affected accounts or be notified of
      security vulnerabilities. By using the organizational view API operations,
      users can enable this feature and retrieve event information.
      Recommendations when utilizing the Health API for returning Health events
      include specifying the eventScopeCode parameter to determine the type of
      Health events to return (public or account-specific) and utilizing
      pagination to view all response events, particularly when using operations
      like DescribeEventsForOrganization to retrieve events across the
      organization.

      recover accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. The
      documentation provides detailed descriptions and syntax for each action
      and data type within Recycle Bin. When you use Recycle Bin, any deleted
      resources are stored in the bin for a specified time period. You have the
      ability to restore a resource from the Recycle Bin before the retention
      period expires. Once a resource is restored, it is removed from the
      Recycle Bin and can be used like any other resource in your account.
      However, if the retention period expires without restoring the resource,
      it will be permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and cannot be
      recovered.

      user input text or voice. For instance, if a user says "I want pizza," the
      bot sends this input to Amazon Lex via the runtime API. Amazon Lex
      identifies the user's request as the OrderPizza intent, engages in a
      conversation to gather necessary information (such as pizza size and crust
      type), and then carries out the fulfillment activity configured during bot
      creation. The build-time API is used to create and manage your Amazon Lex

      The AWS Serverless Application Repository simplifies the process for
      developers and businesses to discover and deploy serverless applications
      in the AWS Cloud. This integration with the AWS Lambda console allows
      developers of all skill levels to easily start with serverless computing.
      Users can search for applications by category keywords such as web and
      mobile backends, data processing, or chatbots, or by name, publisher, or
      event source. Deploying an application is straightforward - simply select
      it, configure any necessary fields, and deploy with a few clicks.
      Applications can be published publicly or privately within a team or
      organization. To publish a serverless app, code can be uploaded using the
      AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, along with a manifest file
      known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. The AWS
      Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide offers detailed
      information on the two available developer experiences: Consuming
      Applications and Publishing Applications.

      The Amazon WorkDocs API is tailored for a variety of use cases, including
      file migration, security applications, and eDiscovery/analytics. The API
      supports file migration applications for users looking to transfer files
      from different systems, while also allowing for basic metadata changes.

      WorkDocs and take necessary actions to ensure data security. General
      administrative applications, such as eDiscovery and analytics, can record
      and replicate data from WorkDocs for backup and analysis purposes.
