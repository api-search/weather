      summary: Cancel Flow Executions
      description: >-
        <p>Cancels active runs for a flow.</p> <p>You can cancel all of the
        active runs for a flow, or you can cancel specific runs by providing
        their IDs.</p> <p>You can cancel a flow run only when the run is in
        progress. You can't cancel a run that has already completed or failed.
        You also can't cancel a run that's scheduled to occur but hasn't started
        yet. To prevent a scheduled run, you can deactivate the flow with the
        <code>StopFlow</code> action.</p> <p>You cannot resume a run after you
        cancel it.</p> <p>When you send your request, the status for each run
        becomes <code>CancelStarted</code>. When the cancellation completes, the
        status becomes <code>Canceled</code>.</p> <note> <p>When you cancel a
        run, you still incur charges for any data that the run already processed
        before the cancellation. If the run had already written some data to the
        flow destination, then that data remains in the destination. If you
        configured the flow to use a batch API (such as the Salesforce Bulk API
        2.0), then the run will finish reading or writing its entire batch of
        data after the cancellation. For these operations, the data processing
        charges for Amazon AppFlow apply. For the pricing information, see <a
        href="http://aws.amazon.com/appflow/pricing/">Amazon AppFlow
        pricing</a>.</p> </note>

      summary: Create Connector Profile
      description: >-
        <p> Creates a new connector profile associated with your Amazon Web
        Services account. There is a soft quota of 100 connector profiles per
        Amazon Web Services account. If you need more connector profiles than
        this quota allows, you can submit a request to the Amazon AppFlow team
        through the Amazon AppFlow support channel. In each connector profile
        that you create, you can provide the credentials and properties for only
        one connector.</p>
