        <p>Creates a link between a source account and a sink that you have
        created in a monitoring account.</p> <p>Before you create a link, you
        must create a sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in
        that account. The sink policy must permit the source account to link to
        it. You can grant permission to source accounts by granting permission
        to an entire organization or to individual accounts.</p> <p>For more
        information, see <a

      description: >-
        <p>Use this to create a <i>sink</i> in the current account, so that it
        can be used as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account
        observability. A sink is a resource that represents an attachment point
        in a monitoring account. Source accounts can link to the sink to send
        observability data.</p> <p>After you create a sink, you must create a
        sink policy that allows source accounts to attach to it. For more
        information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html">PutSinkPolicy</a>.</p>
        <p>Each account can contain one sink. If you delete a sink, you can then
        create a new one in that account.</p>
