      summary: VerifyMac
      description: >-
        <p>Verifies the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) for a
        specified message, HMAC KMS key, and MAC algorithm. To verify the HMAC,
        <code>VerifyMac</code> computes an HMAC using the message, HMAC KMS key,
        and MAC algorithm that you specify, and compares the computed HMAC to
        the HMAC that you specify. If the HMACs are identical, the verification
        succeeds; otherwise, it fails. Verification indicates that the message
        hasn't changed since the HMAC was calculated, and the specified key was
        used to generate and verify the HMAC.</p> <p>HMAC KMS keys and the HMAC
        algorithms that KMS uses conform to industry standards defined in <a
        href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2104">RFC 2104</a>.</p>
        <p>This operation is part of KMS support for HMAC KMS keys. For details,
        see <a

        keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer
        Guide</i>.</p> <p>The KMS key that you use for this operation must be in
        a compatible key state. For details, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-state.html">Key
        states of KMS keys</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer
        Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: Yes. To perform this
        operation with a KMS key in a different Amazon Web Services account,
        specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the <code>KeyId</code>
        parameter. </p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: <a
