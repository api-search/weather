    <p>The Amazon WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p> <ul>
    <li> <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users
    who want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file
    system or service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure,
    as well as allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the
    permissions of files.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security: Support security
    applications are supported for users who have additional security needs,
    such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with
    CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon
    WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace
    the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the application can
    also choose to email the user.</p> </li> <li> <p>eDiscovery/Analytics:
    General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and
    analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or record the actions in
    an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with CloudTrail, to replicate data for
    eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All
    Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed.
    They not only require the use of the Amazon Web Services SDK, but also allow
    for the exclusive use of IAM users and roles to help facilitate access,
    trust, and permission policies. By creating a role and allowing an IAM user
    to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM user gains full administrative
    visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as set in the IAM
    policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file
    permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to
    perform the three use cases above, as well as give users the ability to
    grant access on a selective basis using the IAM model.</p> <note> <p>The
    pricing for Amazon WorkDocs APIs varies depending on the API call type for
    these actions:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>READ (Get*)</code> </p> </li> <li>
    <p> <code>WRITE (Activate*, Add*, Create*, Deactivate*, Initiate*,
    Update*)</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>LIST (Describe*)</code> </p> </li>
    <li> <p> <code>DELETE*, CANCEL</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For information
