    <p>SimSpace Weaver (SimSpace Weaver) is a service that you can use to build
    and run large-scale spatial simulations in the Amazon Web Services Cloud.
    For example, you can create crowd simulations, large real-world
    environments, and immersive and interactive experiences. For more
    information about SimSpace Weaver, see the <i> <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/">SimSpace
    Weaver User Guide</a> </i>.</p> <p>This API reference describes the API
    operations and data types that you can use to communicate directly with
    SimSpace Weaver.</p> <p>SimSpace Weaver also provides the SimSpace Weaver
    app SDK, which you use for app development. The SimSpace Weaver app SDK API
    reference is included in the SimSpace Weaver app SDK documentation. This
    documentation is part of the SimSpace Weaver app SDK distributable
    package.</p>

  /createsnapshot:

      summary: CreateSnapshot
      description: >-
        <p>Creates a snapshot of the specified simulation. A snapshot is a file
        that contains simulation state data at a specific time. The state data
        saved in a snapshot includes entity data from the State Fabric, the
        simulation configuration specified in the schema, and the clock tick
        number. You can use the snapshot to initialize a new simulation. For
        more information about snapshots, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/simspaceweaver/latest/userguide/working-with_snapshots.html">Snapshots</a>
        in the <i>SimSpace Weaver User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You specify a
        <code>Destination</code> when you create a snapshot. The
        <code>Destination</code> is the name of an Amazon S3 bucket and an
        optional <code>ObjectKeyPrefix</code>. The <code>ObjectKeyPrefix</code>
        is usually the name of a folder in the bucket. SimSpace Weaver creates a
        <code>snapshot</code> folder inside the <code>Destination</code> and
        places the snapshot file there.</p> <p>The snapshot file is an Amazon S3
        object. It has an object key with the form: <code>
        <i>object-key-prefix</i>/snapshot/<i>simulation-name</i>-<i>YYMMdd</i>-<i>HHmm</i>-<i>ss</i>.zip</code>,
        where: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code> <i>YY</i> </code> is the 2-digit
        year</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <i>MM</i> </code> is the 2-digit
        month</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <i>dd</i> </code> is the 2-digit day of
        the month</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <i>HH</i> </code> is the 2-digit
        hour (24-hour clock)</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <i>mm</i> </code> is the
        2-digit minutes</p> </li> <li> <p> <code> <i>ss</i> </code> is the
        2-digit seconds</p> </li> </ul>
