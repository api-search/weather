  description: >-
    <p>With Amazon CloudWatch RUM, you can perform real-user monitoring to
    collect client-side data about your web application performance from actual
    user sessions in real time. The data collected includes page load times,
    client-side errors, and user behavior. When you view this data, you can see
    it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by the browsers and
    devices that your customers use.</p> <p>You can use the collected data to
    quickly identify and debug client-side performance issues. CloudWatch RUM
    helps you visualize anomalies in your application performance and find
    relevant debugging data such as error messages, stack traces, and user
    sessions. You can also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact
    including the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.</p>
