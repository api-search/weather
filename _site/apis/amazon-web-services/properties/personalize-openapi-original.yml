        <p>Updates the recommender to modify the recommender configuration. If
        you update the recommender to modify the columns used in training,
        Amazon Personalize automatically starts a full retraining of the models
        backing your recommender. While the update completes, you can still get
        recommendations from the recommender. The recommender uses the previous
        configuration until the update completes. To track the status of this
        update, use the <code>latestRecommenderUpdate</code> returned in the <a

        operation. </p>
