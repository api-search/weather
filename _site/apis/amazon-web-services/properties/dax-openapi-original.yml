    <p>DAX is a managed caching service engineered for Amazon DynamoDB. DAX
    dramatically speeds up database reads by caching frequently-accessed data
    from DynamoDB, so applications can access that data with sub-millisecond
    latency. You can create a DAX cluster easily, using the AWS Management
    Console. With a few simple modifications to your code, your application can
    begin taking advantage of the DAX cluster and realize significant
    improvements in read performance.</p>
