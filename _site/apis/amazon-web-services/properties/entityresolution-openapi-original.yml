    <p>Welcome to the <i>Entity Resolution API Reference</i>.</p> <p>Entity
    Resolution is an Amazon Web Services service that provides pre-configured
    entity resolution capabilities that enable developers and analysts at
    advertising and marketing companies to build an accurate and complete view
    of their consumers.</p> <p> With Entity Resolution, you can match source
    records containing consumer identifiers, such as name, email address, and
    phone number. This is true even when these records have incomplete or
    conflicting identifiers. For example, Entity Resolution can effectively
    match a source record from a customer relationship management (CRM) system
    with a source record from a marketing system containing campaign
    information.</p> <p>To learn more about Entity Resolution concepts,
    procedures, and best practices, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/entityresolution/latest/userguide/what-is-service.html">Entity
    Resolution User Guide</a>.</p>
