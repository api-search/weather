    <p> Amazon DevOps Guru is a fully managed service that helps you identify
    anomalous behavior in business critical operational applications. You
    specify the Amazon Web Services resources that you want DevOps Guru to
    cover, then the Amazon CloudWatch metrics and Amazon Web Services CloudTrail
    events related to those resources are analyzed. When anomalous behavior is
    detected, DevOps Guru creates an <i>insight</i> that includes
    recommendations, related events, and related metrics that can help you
    improve your operational applications. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devops-guru/latest/userguide/welcome.html">What
    is Amazon DevOps Guru</a>. </p> <p> You can specify 1 or 2 Amazon Simple
    Notification Service topics so you are notified every time a new insight is
    created. You can also enable DevOps Guru to generate an OpsItem in Amazon
    Web Services Systems Manager for each insight to help you manage and track
    your work addressing insights. </p> <p> To learn about the DevOps Guru
    workflow, see <a
