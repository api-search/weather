    <fullname>Lambda</fullname> <p> <b>Overview</b> </p> <p>Lambda is a compute
    service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
    Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and
    performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including
    server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic
    scaling, code monitoring and logging. With Lambda, you can run code for
    virtually any type of application or backend service. For more information
    about the Lambda service, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html">What is
    Lambda</a> in the <b>Lambda Developer Guide</b>.</p> <p>The <i>Lambda API
    Reference</i> provides information about each of the API methods, including
    details about the parameters in each API request and response. </p> <p/>
    <p>You can use Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools to access the API. For
    installation instructions, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools
    for Amazon Web Services</a>. </p> <p>For a list of Region-specific endpoints
    that Lambda supports, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/lambda-service.html/">Lambda
    endpoints and quotas </a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
    Reference.</i>. </p> <p>When making the API calls, you will need to
    authenticate your request by providing a signature. Lambda supports
    signature version 4. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
    Version 4 signing process</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
    Reference.</i>. </p> <p> <b>CA certificates</b> </p> <p>Because Amazon Web
    Services SDKs use the CA certificates from your computer, changes to the
    certificates on the Amazon Web Services servers can cause connection
    failures when you attempt to use an SDK. You can prevent these failures by
    keeping your computer's CA certificates and operating system up-to-date. If
    you encounter this issue in a corporate environment and do not manage your
    own computer, you might need to ask an administrator to assist with the
    update process. The following list shows minimum operating system and Java
    versions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Microsoft Windows versions that have updates from
    January 2005 or later installed contain at least one of the required CAs in
    their trust list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Mac OS X 10.4 with Java for Mac OS X
    10.4 Release 5 (February 2007), Mac OS X 10.5 (October 2007), and later
    versions contain at least one of the required CAs in their trust list. </p>
    </li> <li> <p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (March 2007), 6, and 7 and CentOS
    5, 6, and 7 all contain at least one of the required CAs in their default
    trusted CA list. </p> </li> <li> <p>Java 1.4.2_12 (May 2006), 5 Update 2
    (March 2005), and all later versions, including Java 6 (December 2006), 7,
    and 8, contain at least one of the required CAs in their default trusted CA
    list. </p> </li> </ul> <p>When accessing the Lambda management console or
    Lambda API endpoints, whether through browsers or programmatically, you will
    need to ensure your client machines support any of the following CAs: </p>
    <ul> <li> <p>Amazon Root CA 1</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Services Root
    Certificate Authority - G2</p> </li> <li> <p>Starfield Class 2 Certification
    Authority</p> </li> </ul> <p>Root certificates from the first two
    authorities are available from <a
    href="https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/">Amazon trust services</a>,
    but keeping your computer up-to-date is the more straightforward solution.

    POST:
      summary: CreateFunction
      description: >-
        <p>Creates a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html">deployment
        package</a> and an <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/intro-permission-model.html#lambda-intro-execution-role">execution
        role</a>. The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container
        image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the
        function permission to use Amazon Web Services, such as Amazon
        CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request tracing.</p>
        <p>If the deployment package is a <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-images.html">container
        image</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Image</code>. For a
        container image, the code property must include the URI of a container
        image in the Amazon ECR registry. You do not need to specify the handler
        and runtime properties.</p> <p>If the deployment package is a <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-package.html#gettingstarted-package-zip">.zip
        file archive</a>, then you set the package type to <code>Zip</code>. For
        a .zip file archive, the code property specifies the location of the
        .zip file. You must also specify the handler and runtime properties. The
        code in the deployment package must be compatible with the target
        instruction set architecture of the function (<code>x86-64</code> or
        <code>arm64</code>). If you do not specify the architecture, then the
        default value is <code>x86-64</code>.</p> <p>When you create a function,
        Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting
        resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a
        minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function.
        The <code>State</code>, <code>StateReason</code>, and
        <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from
        <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to
        invoke. For more information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html">Lambda
        function states</a>.</p> <p>A function has an unpublished version, and
        can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes
        when you update your function's code and configuration. A published
        version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't
        be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can
        be changed to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code>
        parameter to create version <code>1</code> of your function from its
        initial configuration.</p> <p>The other parameters let you configure
        version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify
        version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>.
        Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published
        versions of the function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and
        per-function concurrency limits (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).</p>
        <p>You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file
        archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a
        code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code
        package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks that the code
        package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing
        configuration includes set of signing profiles, which define the trusted
        publishers for this function.</p> <p>If another Amazon Web Services
        account or an Amazon Web Service invokes your function, use
        <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based
        Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant permissions
        at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.</p> <p>To invoke
        your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>. To invoke your function in
        response to events in other Amazon Web Services, create an event source
        mapping (<a>CreateEventSourceMapping</a>), or configure a function
        trigger in the other service. For more information, see <a

      summary: Invoke
      description: >-
        <p>Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously
        (and wait for the response), or asynchronously. By default, Lambda
        invokes your function synchronously (i.e. the<code>InvocationType</code>
        is <code>RequestResponse</code>). To invoke a function asynchronously,
        set <code>InvocationType</code> to <code>Event</code>. Lambda passes the
        <code>ClientContext</code> object to your function for synchronous
        invocations only.</p> <p>For <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-sync.html">synchronous
        invocation</a>, details about the function response, including errors,
        are included in the response body and headers. For either invocation
        type, you can find more information in the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-functions.html">execution
        log</a> and <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-x-ray.html">trace</a>.</p>
        <p>When an error occurs, your function may be invoked multiple times.
        Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and
        invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously
        and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more
        times. For more information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-retries.html">Error
        handling and automatic retries in Lambda</a>.</p> <p>For <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html">asynchronous
        invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to
        your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up
        with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may
        receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs. To
        retain events that were not processed, configure your function with a <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq">dead-letter
        queue</a>.</p> <p>The status code in the API response doesn't reflect
        function errors. Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your
        function from executing, such as permissions errors, <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html">quota</a>
