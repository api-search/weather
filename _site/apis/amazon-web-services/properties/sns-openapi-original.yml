    Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a web service that enables you to build
    distributed web-enabled applications. Applications can use Amazon SNS to
    easily push real-time notification messages to interested subscribers over
    multiple delivery protocols. For more information about this product see the
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sns/">Amazon SNS product page</a>. For
    detailed information about Amazon SNS features and their associated API
    calls, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/">Amazon
    SNS Developer Guide</a>. </p> <p>For information on the permissions you need
    to use this API, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-authentication-and-access-control.html">Identity
    and access management in Amazon SNS</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer
    Guide.</i> </p> <p>We also provide SDKs that enable you to access Amazon SNS
    from your preferred programming language. The SDKs contain functionality
    that automatically takes care of tasks such as: cryptographically signing
    your service requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses. For
    a list of available SDKs, go to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools

        <p>Verifies a destination phone number with a one-time password (OTP)
        for the calling Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p>When you start using
        Amazon SNS to send SMS messages, your Amazon Web Services account is in
        the <i>SMS sandbox</i>. The SMS sandbox provides a safe environment for
        you to try Amazon SNS features without risking your reputation as an SMS
        sender. While your Amazon Web Services account is in the SMS sandbox,
        you can use all of the features of Amazon SNS. However, you can send SMS
        messages only to verified destination phone numbers. For more
        information, including how to move out of the sandbox to send messages
        without restrictions, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-sms-sandbox.html">SMS
        sandbox</a> in the <i>Amazon SNS Developer Guide</i>.</p>
