    <p>IAM Identity Center OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a web service that enables a
    client (such as CLI or a native application) to register with IAM Identity
    Center. The service also enables the client to fetch the user’s access token
    upon successful authentication and authorization with IAM Identity
    Center.</p> <note> <p>IAM Identity Center uses the <code>sso</code> and
    <code>identitystore</code> API namespaces.</p> </note> <p> <b>Considerations
    for Using This Guide</b> </p> <p>Before you begin using this guide, we
    recommend that you first review the following important information about
    how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p> <ul> <li> <p>The IAM
    Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the
    OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant standard (<a
    href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>)
    that are necessary to enable single sign-on authentication with the CLI.
    </p> </li> <li> <p>With older versions of the CLI, the service only emits
    OIDC access tokens, so to obtain a new token, users must explicitly
    re-authenticate. To access the OIDC flow that supports token refresh and
    doesn’t require re-authentication, update to the latest CLI version (1.27.10
    for CLI V1 and 2.9.0 for CLI V2) with support for OIDC token refresh and
    configurable IAM Identity Center session durations. For more information,
    see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/configure-user-session.html">Configure
    Amazon Web Services access portal session duration </a>. </p> </li> <li>
    <p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all Amazon Web
    Services account entitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not
    just a particular application.</p> </li> <li> <p>The documentation in this
    guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access token into
    Amazon Web Services Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected
    Amazon Web Services service endpoints. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html">GetRoleCredentials</a>
    in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference Guide</i>.</p> </li>
    </ul> <p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">What
    is IAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User
    Guide</i>.</p>
