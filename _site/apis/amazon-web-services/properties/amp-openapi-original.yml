    <p>Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a serverless,
    Prometheus-compatible monitoring service for container metrics that makes it
    easier to securely monitor container environments at scale. With Amazon
    Managed Service for Prometheus, you can use the same open-source Prometheus
    data model and query language that you use today to monitor the performance
    of your containerized workloads, and also enjoy improved scalability,
    availability, and security without having to manage the underlying
    infrastructure.</p> <p>For more information about Amazon Managed Service for
    Prometheus, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/what-is-Amazon-Managed-Service-Prometheus.html">Amazon
    Managed Service for Prometheus</a> User Guide.</p> <p>Amazon Managed Service
    for Prometheus includes two APIs.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the Amazon Web
    Services API described in this guide to manage Amazon Managed Service for
    Prometheus resources, such as workspaces, rule groups, and alert
    managers.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prometheus/latest/userguide/AMP-APIReference.html#AMP-APIReference-Prometheus-Compatible-Apis">Prometheus-compatible
    API</a> to work within your Prometheus workspace.</p> </li> </ul>
