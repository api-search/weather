    <p>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) is a scalable, highly available,
    and managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service. Amazon Keyspaces
    makes it easy to migrate, run, and scale Cassandra workloads in the Amazon
    Web Services Cloud. With just a few clicks on the Amazon Web Services
    Management Console or a few lines of code, you can create keyspaces and
    tables in Amazon Keyspaces, without deploying any infrastructure or
    installing software. </p> <p>In addition to supporting Cassandra Query
    Language (CQL) requests via open-source Cassandra drivers, Amazon Keyspaces
    supports data definition language (DDL) operations to manage keyspaces and
    tables using the Amazon Web Services SDK and CLI, as well as infrastructure
    as code (IaC) services and tools such as CloudFormation and Terraform. This
    API reference describes the supported DDL operations in detail.</p> <p>For
    the list of all supported CQL APIs, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/keyspaces/latest/devguide/cassandra-apis.html">Supported
    Cassandra APIs, operations, and data types in Amazon Keyspaces</a> in the
    <i>Amazon Keyspaces Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>To learn how Amazon
    Keyspaces API actions are recorded with CloudTrail, see <a
