    <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography Control Plane APIs manage
    encryption keys for use during payment-related cryptographic operations. You
    can create, import, export, share, manage, and delete keys. You can also
    manage Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for keys. For more
    information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/security-iam.html">Identity
    and access management</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography
    User Guide.</i> </p> <p>To use encryption keys for payment-related
    transaction processing and associated cryptographic operations, you use the
    <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/DataAPIReference/Welcome.html">Amazon
    Web Services Payment Cryptography Data Plane</a>. You can perform actions
    like encrypt, decrypt, generate, and verify payment-related data.</p> <p>All
    Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography API calls must be signed and
    transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). We recommend you always
    use the latest supported TLS version for logging API requests. </p>
    <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports CloudTrail for control
    plane operations, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and
    related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an
    Amazon S3 bucket you specify. By using the information collected by
    CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to Amazon Web Services
    Payment Cryptography, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. If
    you don't conÔ¨Ågure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the
    CloudTrail console. For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">CloudTrail
    User Guide</a>.</p>
