    <p>Use Amazon CloudWatch Observability Access Manager to create and manage
    links between source accounts and monitoring accounts by using <i>CloudWatch
    cross-account observability</i>. With CloudWatch cross-account
    observability, you can monitor and troubleshoot applications that span
    multiple accounts within a Region. Seamlessly search, visualize, and analyze
    your metrics, logs, traces, and Application Insights applications in any of
    the linked accounts without account boundaries.</p> <p>Set up one or more
    Amazon Web Services accounts as <i>monitoring accounts</i> and link them
    with multiple <i>source accounts</i>. A monitoring account is a central
    Amazon Web Services account that can view and interact with observability
    data generated from source accounts. A source account is an individual
    Amazon Web Services account that generates observability data for the
    resources that reside in it. Source accounts share their observability data
    with the monitoring account. The shared observability data can include
    metrics in Amazon CloudWatch, logs in Amazon CloudWatch Logs, traces in
    X-Ray, and applications in Amazon CloudWatch Application Insights.</p>

        <p>Creates a link between a source account and a sink that you have
        created in a monitoring account.</p> <p>Before you create a link, you
        must create a sink in the monitoring account and create a sink policy in
        that account. The sink policy must permit the source account to link to
        it. You can grant permission to source accounts by granting permission
        to an entire organization or to individual accounts.</p> <p>For more
        information, see <a

        <p>Each monitoring account can be linked to as many as 100,000 source

      description: >-
        <p>Use this to create a <i>sink</i> in the current account, so that it
        can be used as a monitoring account in CloudWatch cross-account
        observability. A sink is a resource that represents an attachment point
        in a monitoring account. Source accounts can link to the sink to send
        observability data.</p> <p>After you create a sink, you must create a
        sink policy that allows source accounts to attach to it. For more
        information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/OAM/latest/APIReference/API_PutSinkPolicy.html">PutSinkPolicy</a>.</p>
