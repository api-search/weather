    <p>This is the <i>Amazon Web Services Private Certificate Authority API
    Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each
    of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private
    certificate authority (CA) for your organization.</p> <p>The documentation
    for each action shows the API request parameters and the JSON response.
    Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an
    API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you
    prefer. For more information, see <a
    href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.</p>
    <p>Each Amazon Web Services Private CA API operation has a quota that
    determines the number of times the operation can be called per second.
    Amazon Web Services Private CA throttles API requests at different rates
    depending on the operation. Throttling means that Amazon Web Services
    Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request exceeds
    the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When a request
    is throttled, Amazon Web Services Private CA returns a <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/privateca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
    error. Amazon Web Services Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
    rate for APIs. </p> <p>To see an up-to-date list of your Amazon Web Services
    Private CA quotas, or to request a quota increase, log into your Amazon Web
    Services account and visit the <a
    href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a>
    console.</p>

        <p>Updates the status or configuration of a private certificate
        authority (CA). Your private CA must be in the <code>ACTIVE</code> or
        <code>DISABLED</code> state before you can update it. You can disable a
        private CA that is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state or make a CA that is
        in the <code>DISABLED</code> state active again.</p> <note> <p>Both
        Amazon Web Services Private CA and the IAM principal must have
        permission to write to the S3 bucket that you specify. If the IAM
        principal making the call does not have permission to write to the
        bucket, then an exception is thrown. For more information, see <a
