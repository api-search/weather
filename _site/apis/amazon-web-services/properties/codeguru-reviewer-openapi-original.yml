    <p>This section provides documentation for the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer API
    operations. CodeGuru Reviewer is a service that uses program analysis and
    machine learning to detect potential defects that are difficult for
    developers to find and recommends fixes in your Java and Python code.</p>
    <p>By proactively detecting and providing recommendations for addressing
    code defects and implementing best practices, CodeGuru Reviewer improves the
    overall quality and maintainability of your code base during the code review
    stage. For more information about CodeGuru Reviewer, see the <i> <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/welcome.html">Amazon
    CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide</a>.</i> </p> <p>To improve the security of
    your CodeGuru Reviewer API calls, you can establish a private connection
    between your VPC and CodeGuru Reviewer by creating an <i>interface VPC
    endpoint</i>. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-ug/vpc-interface-endpoints.html">CodeGuru
    Reviewer and interface VPC endpoints (Amazon Web Services PrivateLink)</a>
