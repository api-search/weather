    <p>Welcome to the Zonal Shift API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53
    Application Recovery Controller (Route 53 ARC).</p> <p>You can start a zonal
    shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away from an Availability
    Zone to help your application recover quickly from an impairment in an
    Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your application from a
    developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services
    infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.</p> <p>You can also
    configure zonal autoshift for a load balancer resource. Zonal autoshift is a
    capability in Route 53 ARC where Amazon Web Services shifts away application
    resource traffic from an Availability Zone, on your behalf, to help reduce
    your time to recovery during events. Amazon Web Services shifts away traffic
    for resources that are enabled for zonal autoshift whenever Amazon Web
    Services determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that
    could potentially affect customers.</p> <p>To ensure that zonal autoshift is
    safe for your application, you must also configure practice runs when you
    enable zonal autoshift for a resource. Practice runs start weekly zonal
    shifts for a resource, to shift traffic for the resource out of an
    Availability Zone. Practice runs make sure, on a regular basis, that you
    have enough capacity in all the Availability Zones in an Amazon Web Services
    Region for your application to continue to operate normally when traffic for
    a resource is shifted away from one Availability Zone.</p> <important>
    <p>You must prescale resource capacity in all Availability Zones in the
    Region where your application is deployed, before you configure practice
    runs or enable zonal autoshift for a resource. You should not rely on
    scaling on demand when an autoshift or practice run starts. </p>

    autoshift, see the <a

        <p>Update an active zonal shift in Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
        Controller in your Amazon Web Services account. You can update a zonal
        shift to set a new expiration, or edit or replace the comment for the
        zonal shift. </p>

      summary: CreatePracticeRunConfiguration
      description: >-
        <p>A practice run configuration for zonal autoshift is required when you
        enable zonal autoshift. A practice run configuration includes
        specifications for blocked dates and blocked time windows, and for
        Amazon CloudWatch alarms that you create to use with practice runs. The
        alarms that you specify are an <i>outcome alarm</i>, to monitor
        application health during practice runs and, optionally, a <i>blocking
        alarm</i>, to block practice runs from starting.</p> <p>For more

    PATCH:
      summary: UpdatePracticeRunConfiguration
      description: >-
        <p>Update a practice run configuration to change one or more of the
        following: add, change, or remove the blocking alarm; change the outcome
        alarm; or add, change, or remove blocking dates or time windows.</p>

      description: >-
        <p>You can update the zonal autoshift status for a resource, to enable
        or disable zonal autoshift. When zonal autoshift is
        <code>ENABLED</code>, Amazon Web Services shifts away resource traffic
        from an Availability Zone, on your behalf, when Amazon Web Services
        determines that there's an issue in the Availability Zone that could
        potentially affect customers.</p>
  /autoshifts:
    GET:
      summary: ListAutoshifts
      description: <p>Returns the active autoshifts for a specified resource.</p>
  /managedresources:
    GET:
      summary: ListManagedResources
      description: >-
        <p>Lists all the resources in your Amazon Web Services account in this
        Amazon Web Services Region that are managed for zonal shifts in Amazon
        Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, and information about them.
        The information includes the zonal autoshift status for the resource, as
        well as the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), the Availability Zones that each
        resource is deployed in, and the resource name.</p>
  /zonalshifts:
    POST:
      summary: StartZonalShift
      description: >-
        <p>You start a zonal shift to temporarily move load balancer traffic
        away from an Availability Zone in an Amazon Web Services Region, to help
        your application recover immediately, for example, from a developer's
        bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web Services infrastructure
        failure in a single Availability Zone. You can start a zonal shift in
        Route 53 ARC only for managed resources in your Amazon Web Services
        account in an Amazon Web Services Region. Resources are automatically
        registered with Route 53 ARC by Amazon Web Services services.</p> <p>At
        this time, you can only start a zonal shift for Network Load Balancers
        and Application Load Balancers with cross-zone load balancing turned
        off.</p> <p>When you start a zonal shift, traffic for the resource is no
        longer routed to the Availability Zone. The zonal shift is created
        immediately in Route 53 ARC. However, it can take a short time,
        typically up to a few minutes, for existing, in-progress connections in
        the Availability Zone to complete.</p> <p>For more information, see <a
