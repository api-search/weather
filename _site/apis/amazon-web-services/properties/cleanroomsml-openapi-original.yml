    <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML API
    Reference</i>.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML provides a
    privacy-enhancing method for two parties to identify similar users in their
    data without the need to share their data with each other. The first party
    brings the training data to Clean Rooms so that they can create and
    configure an audience model (lookalike model) and associate it with a
    collaboration. The second party then brings their seed data to Clean Rooms
    and generates an audience (lookalike segment) that resembles the training
    data.</p> <p>To learn more about Amazon Web Services Clean Rooms ML
    concepts, procedures, and best practices, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/latest/userguide/machine-learning.html">Clean
    Rooms User Guide</a>.</p> <p>To learn more about SQL commands, functions,
