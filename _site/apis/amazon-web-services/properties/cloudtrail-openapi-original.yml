    <fullname>CloudTrail</fullname> <p>This is the CloudTrail API Reference. It
    provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common
    errors for CloudTrail.</p> <p>CloudTrail is a web service that records
    Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and
    delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes
    the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API
    call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response
    elements returned by the service.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to the
    API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of
    libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms
    (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access
    to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing
    requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more
    information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download
    and install them, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools to Build
    on Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>See the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html">CloudTrail
    User Guide</a> for information about the data that is included with each
    Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files.</p>

      summary: UpdateTrail
      description: >-
        <p>Updates trail settings that control what events you are logging, and
        how to handle log files. Changes to a trail do not require stopping the
        CloudTrail service. Use this action to designate an existing bucket for
        log delivery. If the existing bucket has previously been a target for
        CloudTrail log files, an IAM policy exists for the bucket.
        <code>UpdateTrail</code> must be called from the Region in which the
        trail was created; otherwise, an <code>InvalidHomeRegionException</code>
        is thrown.</p>
