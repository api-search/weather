    <p>Identity and Access Management Roles Anywhere provides a secure way for
    your workloads such as servers, containers, and applications that run
    outside of Amazon Web Services to obtain temporary Amazon Web Services
    credentials. Your workloads can use the same IAM policies and roles you have
    for native Amazon Web Services applications to access Amazon Web Services
    resources. Using IAM Roles Anywhere eliminates the need to manage long-term
    credentials for workloads running outside of Amazon Web Services.</p> <p> To
    use IAM Roles Anywhere, your workloads must use X.509 certificates issued by
    their certificate authority (CA). You register the CA with IAM Roles
    Anywhere as a trust anchor to establish trust between your public key
    infrastructure (PKI) and IAM Roles Anywhere. If you don't manage your own
    PKI system, you can use Private Certificate Authority to create a CA and
    then use that to establish trust with IAM Roles Anywhere. </p> <p>This guide
    describes the IAM Roles Anywhere operations that you can call
    programmatically. For more information about IAM Roles Anywhere, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html">IAM
    Roles Anywhere User Guide</a>.</p>

      summary: UpdateTrustAnchor
      description: >-
        <p>Updates a trust anchor. You establish trust between IAM Roles
        Anywhere and your certificate authority (CA) by configuring a trust
        anchor. You can define a trust anchor as a reference to an Private
        Certificate Authority (Private CA) or by uploading a CA certificate.
        Your Amazon Web Services workloads can authenticate with the trust
        anchor using certificates issued by the CA in exchange for temporary
        Amazon Web Services credentials.</p> <p> <b>Required permissions: </b>
