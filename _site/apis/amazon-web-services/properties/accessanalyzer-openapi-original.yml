    <p>Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer helps you to set, verify,
    and refine your IAM policies by providing a suite of capabilities. Its
    features include findings for external and unused access, basic and custom
    policy checks for validating policies, and policy generation to generate
    fine-grained policies. To start using IAM Access Analyzer to identify
    external or unused access, you first need to create an analyzer.</p> <p>
    <b>External access analyzers</b> help identify potential risks of accessing
    resources by enabling you to identify any resource policies that grant
    access to an external principal. It does this by using logic-based reasoning
    to analyze resource-based policies in your Amazon Web Services environment.
    An external principal can be another Amazon Web Services account, a root
    user, an IAM user or role, a federated user, an Amazon Web Services service,
    or an anonymous user. You can also use IAM Access Analyzer to preview public
    and cross-account access to your resources before deploying permissions
    changes.</p> <p> <b>Unused access analyzers</b> help identify potential
    identity access risks by enabling you to identify unused IAM roles, unused
    access keys, unused console passwords, and IAM principals with unused
    service and action-level permissions.</p> <p>Beyond findings, IAM Access
    Analyzer provides basic and custom policy checks to validate IAM policies
    before deploying permissions changes. You can use policy generation to
    refine permissions by attaching a policy generated using access activity
    logged in CloudTrail logs. </p> <p>This guide describes the IAM Access
    Analyzer operations that you can call programmatically. For general
    information about IAM Access Analyzer, see <a
