    <p>Amazon WorkLink is a cloud-based service that provides secure access to
    internal websites and web apps from iOS and Android phones. In a single
    step, your users, such as employees, can access internal websites as
    efficiently as they access any other public website. They enter a URL in
    their web browser, or choose a link to an internal website in an email.
    Amazon WorkLink authenticates the user's access and securely renders
    authorized internal web content in a secure rendering service in the AWS
    cloud. Amazon WorkLink doesn't download or store any internal web content on
    mobile devices.</p>
