    <fullname>WAF</fullname> <note> <p>This is the latest version of the
    <b>WAF</b> API, released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that
    you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the
    versioning information added, like "V2" or "v2", to distinguish from the
    prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version,
    because it has a number of significant improvements.</p> <p>If you used WAF
    prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF
    resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs,
    and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic
    APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. </p> <p>For
    information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version,
    see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF
    Developer Guide</a>. </p> </note> <p>WAF is a web application firewall that
    lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon
    CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load
    Balancer, AppSync GraphQL API, Amazon Cognito user pool, App Runner service,
    or Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. WAF also lets you control
    access to your content, to protect the Amazon Web Services resource that WAF
    is monitoring. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP
    addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the
    protected resource responds to requests with either the requested content,
    an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden), or with a custom response. </p> <p>This
    API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API
    actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features
    and guidance for configuring and using WAF, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF
    Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>You can make calls using the endpoints listed in
    <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF
    endpoints and quotas</a>. </p> <ul> <li> <p>For regional applications, you
    can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an
    Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an AppSync
    GraphQL API, an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an
    Amazon Web Services Verified Access instance. </p> </li> <li> <p>For Amazon
    CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East
    (N. Virginia): us-east-1.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Alternatively, you can use one
    of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the
    programming language or platform that you're using. For more information,
    see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services
    SDKs</a>.</p> <p>We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API
    and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same
    functionality as the older versions, with the following major
    improvements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You use one API for both global and regional
    applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a
    <code>Scope</code> parameter and set it to <code>CLOUDFRONT</code> or
    <code>REGIONAL</code>. </p> </li> <li> <p>You can define a web ACL or rule
    group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all
    rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web
    ACL calls.</p> </li> <li> <p>The limits WAF places on the use of rules more
    closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include
    capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use
    it.</p> </li> </ul>

      summary: UpdateWebACL
      description: >-
        <p>Updates the specified <a>WebACL</a>. While updating a web ACL, WAF
        provides continuous coverage to the resources that you have associated
        with the web ACL. </p> <note> <p>This operation completely replaces the
        mutable specifications that you already have for the web ACL with the
        ones that you provide to this call. </p> <p>To modify a web ACL, do the
        following: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Retrieve it by calling <a>GetWebACL</a>
        </p> </li> <li> <p>Update its settings as needed</p> </li> <li>
        <p>Provide the complete web ACL specification to this call</p> </li>
        </ol> </note> <p> A web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to
        inspect and control web requests. Each rule has a statement that defines
        what to look for in web requests and an action that WAF applies to
        requests that match the statement. In the web ACL, you assign a default
        action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of
        the rules. The rules in a web ACL can be a combination of the types
        <a>Rule</a>, <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate
        a web ACL with one or more Amazon Web Services resources to protect. The
        resources can be an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API
        Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, an AppSync GraphQL API,
        an Amazon Cognito user pool, an App Runner service, or an Amazon Web
        Services Verified Access instance. </p> <p> <b>Temporary inconsistencies
        during updates</b> </p> <p>When you create or change a web ACL or other
        WAF resources, the changes take a small amount of time to propagate to
        all areas where the resources are stored. The propagation time can be
        from a few seconds to a number of minutes. </p> <p>The following are
        examples of the temporary inconsistencies that you might notice during
        change propagation: </p> <ul> <li> <p>After you create a web ACL, if you
        try to associate it with a resource, you might get an exception
        indicating that the web ACL is unavailable. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you
        add a rule group to a web ACL, the new rule group rules might be in
        effect in one area where the web ACL is used and not in another.</p>
        </li> <li> <p>After you change a rule action setting, you might see the
        old action in some places and the new action in others. </p> </li> <li>
        <p>After you add an IP address to an IP set that is in use in a blocking
        rule, the new address might be blocked in one area while still allowed
        in another.</p> </li> </ul>
