    Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to Amazon
    Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security
    credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which Amazon
    Web Services resources users and applications can access. For more
    information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and
    Access Management (IAM)</a> and the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Identity and Access
    Management User Guide</a>.</p>

      summary: UploadSigningCertificate
      description: >-
        <p>Uploads an X.509 signing certificate and associates it with the
        specified IAM user. Some Amazon Web Services services require you to use
        certificates to validate requests that are signed with a corresponding
        private key. When you upload the certificate, its default status is
        <code>Active</code>.</p> <p>For information about when you would use an
        X.509 signing certificate, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html">Managing
        server certificates in IAM</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If
        the <code>UserName</code> is not specified, the IAM user name is
        determined implicitly based on the Amazon Web Services access key ID
        used to sign the request. This operation works for access keys under the
        Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to
        manage Amazon Web Services account root user credentials even if the
        Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.</p> <note>
        <p>Because the body of an X.509 certificate can be large, you should use
        POST rather than GET when calling <code>UploadSigningCertificate</code>.
