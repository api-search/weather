    <p>Amazon Polly is a web service that makes it easy to synthesize speech
    from text.</p> <p>The Amazon Polly service provides API operations for
    synthesizing high-quality speech from plain text and Speech Synthesis Markup
    Language (SSML), along with managing pronunciations lexicons that enable you
    to get the best results for your application domain.</p>
paths:
  /v1/lexicons/{LexiconName}:
    PUT:
      summary: PutLexicon
      description: >-
        <p>Stores a pronunciation lexicon in an Amazon Web Services Region. If a
        lexicon with the same name already exists in the region, it is
        overwritten by the new lexicon. Lexicon operations have eventual
        consistency, therefore, it might take some time before the lexicon is
        available to the SynthesizeSpeech operation.</p> <p>For more
        information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/managing-lexicons.html">Managing
        Lexicons</a>.</p>
  /v1/voices:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeVoices
      description: >-
        <p>Returns the list of voices that are available for use when requesting
        speech synthesis. Each voice speaks a specified language, is either male
        or female, and is identified by an ID, which is the ASCII version of the
        voice name. </p> <p>When synthesizing speech (
        <code>SynthesizeSpeech</code> ), you provide the voice ID for the voice
        you want from the list of voices returned by
        <code>DescribeVoices</code>.</p> <p>For example, you want your news
        reader application to read news in a specific language, but giving a
        user the option to choose the voice. Using the
        <code>DescribeVoices</code> operation you can provide the user with a
        list of available voices to select from.</p> <p> You can optionally
        specify a language code to filter the available voices. For example, if
        you specify <code>en-US</code>, the operation returns a list of all
        available US English voices. </p> <p>This operation requires permissions
        to perform the <code>polly:DescribeVoices</code> action.</p>
  /v1/synthesisTasks/{TaskId}:
    GET:
      summary: GetSpeechSynthesisTask
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves a specific SpeechSynthesisTask object based on its TaskID.
        This object contains information about the given speech synthesis task,
        including the status of the task, and a link to the S3 bucket containing
        the output of the task.</p>
  /v1/lexicons:
    GET:
      summary: ListLexicons
      description: >-
        <p>Returns a list of pronunciation lexicons stored in an Amazon Web
        Services Region. For more information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/managing-lexicons.html">Managing
        Lexicons</a>.</p>
  /v1/synthesisTasks:
    POST:
      summary: StartSpeechSynthesisTask
      description: >-
        <p>Allows the creation of an asynchronous synthesis task, by starting a
        new <code>SpeechSynthesisTask</code>. This operation requires all the
        standard information needed for speech synthesis, plus the name of an
        Amazon S3 bucket for the service to store the output of the synthesis
        task and two optional parameters (<code>OutputS3KeyPrefix</code> and
        <code>SnsTopicArn</code>). Once the synthesis task is created, this
        operation will return a <code>SpeechSynthesisTask</code> object, which
        will include an identifier of this task as well as the current status.
        The <code>SpeechSynthesisTask</code> object is available for 72 hours
        after starting the asynchronous synthesis task.</p>
  /v1/speech:
    POST:
      summary: SynthesizeSpeech
      description: >-
        <p>Synthesizes UTF-8 input, plain text or SSML, to a stream of bytes.
        SSML input must be valid, well-formed SSML. Some alphabets might not be
        available with all the voices (for example, Cyrillic might not be read
        at all by English voices) unless phoneme mapping is used. For more
        information, see <a

        it Works</a>.</p>
