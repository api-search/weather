    <p>You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to
    create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to your snapshots, read
    data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between two
    snapshots. If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup
    services for Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and
    cost-effective to track incremental changes on your Amazon EBS volumes
    through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
    from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
    instances to compare the differences.</p> <p>You can create incremental
    snapshots directly from data on-premises into volumes and the cloud to use
    for quick disaster recovery. With the ability to write and read snapshots,
    you can write your on-premises data to an snapshot during a disaster. Then
    after recovery, you can restore it back to Amazon Web Services or
    on-premises from the snapshot. You no longer need to build and maintain
    complex mechanisms to copy data to and from Amazon EBS.</p> <p>This API
    reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
    parameters, and errors of the EBS direct APIs. For more information about
    the elements that make up the EBS direct APIs, and examples of how to use
    them effectively, see <a

    the Contents of an Amazon EBS Snapshot</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Compute
