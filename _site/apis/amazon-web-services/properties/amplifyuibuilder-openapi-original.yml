    <p>The Amplify UI Builder API provides a programmatic interface for creating
    and configuring user interface (UI) component libraries and themes for use
    in your Amplify applications. You can then connect these UI components to an
    application's backend Amazon Web Services resources.</p> <p>You can also use
    the Amplify Studio visual designer to create UI components and model data
    for an app. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.amplify.aws/console/adminui/intro">Introduction</a> in
    the <i>Amplify Docs</i>.</p> <p>The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set
    of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation for client app development. For
    more information, see the <a href="https://docs.amplify.aws/">Amplify
    Framework</a>. For more information about deploying an Amplify application
    to Amazon Web Services, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Amplify
    User Guide</a>.</p>
