    <p>Compute Optimizer is a service that analyzes the configuration and
    utilization metrics of your Amazon Web Services compute resources, such as
    Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, Lambda functions,
    Amazon EBS volumes, and Amazon ECS services on Fargate. It reports whether
    your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to
    reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads. Compute
    Optimizer also provides recent utilization metric data, in addition to
    projected utilization metric data for the recommendations, which you can use
    to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance
    trade-off. The analysis of your usage patterns can help you decide when to
    move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and
    capacity requirements. For more information about Compute Optimizer,
    including the required permissions to use the service, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/">Compute
    Optimizer User Guide</a>.</p>
