        <p>Updates the maintenance configuration of the Kinesis Data Analytics
        application. </p> <p>You can invoke this operation on an application
        that is in one of the two following states: <code>READY</code> or
        <code>RUNNING</code>. If you invoke it when the application is in a
        state other than these two states, it throws a
        <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. The service makes use of the
        updated configuration the next time it schedules maintenance for the
        application. If you invoke this operation after the service schedules
        maintenance, the service will apply the configuration update the next
        time it schedules maintenance for the application. This means that you
        might not see the maintenance configuration update applied to the
        maintenance process that follows a successful invocation of this
        operation, but to the following maintenance process instead.</p> <p>To
        see the current maintenance configuration of your application, invoke
        the <a>DescribeApplication</a> operation.</p> <p>For information about
        application maintenance, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/java/maintenance.html">Kinesis
        Data Analytics for Apache Flink Maintenance</a>.</p> <note> <p>This
        operation is supported only for Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for Apache
        Flink.</p> </note>
