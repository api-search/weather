    <p>Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service
    that uses machine learning and pattern matching to help you discover and
    protect your sensitive data in AWS. Macie automates the discovery of
    sensitive data, such as PII and intellectual property, to provide you with
    insight into the data that your organization stores in AWS. Macie also
    provides an inventory of your Amazon S3 buckets, which it continually
    monitors for you. If Macie detects sensitive data or potential data access
    issues, it generates detailed findings for you to review and act upon as
    necessary.</p>
