        <p>Removes the specified tags from the specified resources. When you
        specify a tag key, the action removes both that key and its associated
        value. The operation succeeds even if you attempt to remove tags from a
        resource that were already removed. Note the following:</p> <ul> <li>
        <p>To remove tags from a resource, you need the necessary permissions
        for the service that the resource belongs to as well as permissions for
        removing tags. For more information, see the documentation for the
        service whose resource you want to untag.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can only
        tag resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services
        Region for the calling Amazon Web Services account.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
        <b>Minimum permissions</b> </p> <p>In addition to the
        <code>tag:UntagResources</code> permission required by this operation,
        you must also have the remove tags permission defined by the service
        that created the resource. For example, to remove the tags from an
        Amazon EC2 instance using the <code>UntagResources</code> operation, you
        must have both of the following permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
        <code>tag:UntagResource</code> </p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>ec2:DeleteTags</code> </p> </li> </ul>
