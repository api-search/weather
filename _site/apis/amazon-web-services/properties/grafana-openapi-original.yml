    <p>Amazon Managed Grafana is a fully managed and secure data visualization
    service that you can use to instantly query, correlate, and visualize
    operational metrics, logs, and traces from multiple sources. Amazon Managed
    Grafana makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale Grafana, a widely
    deployed data visualization tool that is popular for its extensible data
    support.</p> <p>With Amazon Managed Grafana, you create logically isolated
    Grafana servers called <i>workspaces</i>. In a workspace, you can create
    Grafana dashboards and visualizations to analyze your metrics, logs, and
    traces without having to build, package, or deploy any hardware to run
    Grafana servers. </p>
