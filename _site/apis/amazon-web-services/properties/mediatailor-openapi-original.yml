    <p>Use the AWS Elemental MediaTailor SDKs and CLI to configure scalable ad
    insertion and linear channels. With MediaTailor, you can assemble existing
    content into a linear stream and serve targeted ads to viewers while
    maintaining broadcast quality in over-the-top (OTT) video applications. For
    information about using the service, including detailed information about
    the settings covered in this guide, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediatailor/latest/ug/">AWS Elemental
    MediaTailor User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Through the SDKs and the CLI you manage
    AWS Elemental MediaTailor configurations and channels the same as you do
    through the console. For example, you specify ad insertion behavior and
    mapping information for the origin server and the ad decision server
    (ADS).</p>
