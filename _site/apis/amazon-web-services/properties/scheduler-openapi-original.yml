    <p> Amazon EventBridge Scheduler is a serverless scheduler that allows you
    to create, run, and manage tasks from one central, managed service.
    EventBridge Scheduler delivers your tasks reliably, with built-in mechanisms
    that adjust your schedules based on the availability of downstream targets.
    The following reference lists the available API actions, and data types for
    EventBridge Scheduler. </p>
paths:
  /schedules/{Name}:
    PUT:
      summary: UpdateSchedule
      description: >-
        <p> Updates the specified schedule. When you call
        <code>UpdateSchedule</code>, EventBridge Scheduler uses all values,
        including empty values, specified in the request and overrides the
        existing schedule. This is by design. This means that if you do not set
        an optional field in your request, that field will be set to its
        system-default value after the update. </p> <p> Before calling this
        operation, we recommend that you call the <code>GetSchedule</code> API
        operation and make a note of all optional parameters for your
        <code>UpdateSchedule</code> call. </p>
