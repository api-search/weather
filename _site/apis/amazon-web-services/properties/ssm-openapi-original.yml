      summary: UpdateServiceSetting
      description: >-
        <p> <code>ServiceSetting</code> is an account-level setting for an
        Amazon Web Services service. This setting defines how a user interacts
        with or uses a service or a feature of a service. For example, if an
        Amazon Web Services service charges money to the account based on
        feature or service usage, then the Amazon Web Services service team
        might create a default setting of "false". This means the user can't use
        this feature unless they change the setting to "true" and intentionally
        opt in for a paid feature.</p> <p>Services map a <code>SettingId</code>
        object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services teams define the
        default value for a <code>SettingId</code>. You can't create a new
        <code>SettingId</code>, but you can overwrite the default value if you
        have the <code>ssm:UpdateServiceSetting</code> permission for the
        setting. Use the <a>GetServiceSetting</a> API operation to view the
        current value. Or, use the <a>ResetServiceSetting</a> to change the
        value back to the original value defined by the Amazon Web Services
        service team.</p> <p>Update the service setting for the account. </p>
