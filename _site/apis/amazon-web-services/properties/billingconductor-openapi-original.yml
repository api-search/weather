    <p>Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor is a fully managed service that you
    can use to customize a <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/latest/userguide/understanding-eb.html#eb-other-definitions">proforma</a>
    version of your billing data each month, to accurately show or chargeback
    your end customers. Amazon Web Services Billing Conductor doesn't change the
    way you're billed by Amazon Web Services each month by design. Instead, it
    provides you with a mechanism to configure, generate, and display rates to
    certain customers over a given billing period. You can also analyze the
    difference between the rates you apply to your accounting groupings relative
    to your actual rates from Amazon Web Services. As a result of your Amazon
    Web Services Billing Conductor configuration, the payer account can also see
    the custom rate applied on the billing details page of the <a
    href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing">Amazon Web Services Billing
    console</a>, or configure a cost and usage report per billing group.</p>
    <p>This documentation shows how you can configure Amazon Web Services
    Billing Conductor using its API. For more information about using the <a
    href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/">Amazon Web Services
    Billing Conductor</a> user interface, see the <a
