    <p>Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You
    can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from cloud,
    on-premises, and custom sources into a data lake that's stored in your
    Amazon Web Services account. Amazon Web Services Organizations is an account
    management service that lets you consolidate multiple Amazon Web Services
    accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With
    Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts
    to join your organization. Security Lake helps you analyze security data for
    a more complete understanding of your security posture across the entire
    organization. It can also help you improve the protection of your workloads,
    applications, and data.</p> <p>The data lake is backed by Amazon Simple
    Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and you retain ownership over your
    data.</p> <p>Amazon Security Lake integrates with CloudTrail, a service that
    provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an Amazon Web
    Services service. In Security Lake, CloudTrail captures API calls for
    Security Lake as events. The calls captured include calls from the Security
    Lake console and code calls to the Security Lake API operations. If you
    create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to
    an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Security Lake. If you don't
    configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the
    CloudTrail console in Event history. Using the information collected by
    CloudTrail you can determine the request that was made to Security Lake, the
    IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it
    was made, and additional details. To learn more about Security Lake
    information in CloudTrail, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/security-lake/latest/userguide/securitylake-cloudtrail.html">Amazon
    Security Lake User Guide</a>.</p> <p>Security Lake automates the collection
    of security-related log and event data from integrated Amazon Web Services
    and third-party services. It also helps you manage the lifecycle of data
    with customizable retention and replication settings. Security Lake converts
    ingested data into Apache Parquet format and a standard open-source schema
    called the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF).</p> <p>Other Amazon
    Web Services and third-party services can subscribe to the data that's
    stored in Security Lake for incident response and security data
    analytics.</p>
paths:
  /v1/datalake/logsources/aws:
    POST:
      summary: CreateAwsLogSource
      description: >-
        <p>Adds a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security
        Lake source. Enables source types for member accounts in required Amazon
        Web Services Regions, based on the parameters you specify. You can
        choose any source type in any Region for either accounts that are part
        of a trusted organization or standalone accounts. Once you add an Amazon
        Web Service as a source, Security Lake starts collecting logs and events
        from it.</p> <p>You can use this API only to enable natively supported
        Amazon Web Services as a source. Use <code>CreateCustomLogSource</code>
        to enable data collection from a custom source.</p>
  /v1/datalake/logsources/custom:
    POST:
      summary: CreateCustomLogSource
      description: >-
        <p>Adds a third-party custom source in Amazon Security Lake, from the
        Amazon Web Services Region where you want to create a custom source.
        Security Lake can collect logs and events from third-party custom
        sources. After creating the appropriate IAM role to invoke Glue crawler,
        use this API to add a custom source name in Security Lake. This
        operation creates a partition in the Amazon S3 bucket for Security Lake
        as the target location for log files from the custom source. In
        addition, this operation also creates an associated Glue table and an
        Glue crawler.</p>
  /v1/datalake:
    PUT:
      summary: UpdateDataLake
      description: >-
        <p>Specifies where to store your security data and for how long. You can

      summary: DeleteAwsLogSource
      description: >-
        <p>Removes a natively supported Amazon Web Service as an Amazon Security
        Lake source. You can remove a source for one or more Regions. When you
        remove the source, Security Lake stops collecting data from that source
        in the specified Regions and accounts, and subscribers can no longer
        consume new data from the source. However, subscribers can still consume
        data that Security Lake collected from the source before removal.</p>
        <p>You can choose any source type in any Amazon Web Services Region for
        either accounts that are part of a trusted organization or standalone

      description: >-
        <p>When you disable Amazon Security Lake from your account, Security
        Lake is disabled in all Amazon Web Services Regions and it stops
        collecting data from your sources. Also, this API automatically takes
        steps to remove the account from Security Lake. However, Security Lake
        retains all of your existing settings and the resources that it created
        in your Amazon Web Services account in the current Amazon Web Services
        Region.</p> <p>The <code>DeleteDataLake</code> operation does not delete
        the data that is stored in your Amazon S3 bucket, which is owned by your
        Amazon Web Services account. For more information, see the <a
