    <p>Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor is an Amazon Web Services active
    network monitoring service that identifies if a network issues exists within
    the Amazon Web Services network or your own company network. Within Network
    Monitor you'll choose the source VPCs and subnets from the Amazon Web
    Services network in which you operate and then you'll choose the destination
    IP addresses from your on-premises network. From these sources and
    destinations, Network Monitor creates a monitor containing all the possible
    source and destination combinations, each of which is called a probe, within
    a single monitor. These probes then monitor network traffic to help you
    identify where network issues might be affecting your traffic.</p> <p>For
