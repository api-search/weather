  description: >-
    <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help
    you to analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web
    Services (Amazon Web Services) workloads. Detective automatically extracts
    time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic
    from CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It
    also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.</p> <p>The Detective
    API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A
    behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts,
    and is created and managed by an administrator account.</p> <p>To add a
    member account to the behavior graph, the administrator account sends an
    invitation to the account. When the account accepts the invitation, it
    becomes a member account in the behavior graph.</p> <p>Detective is also
    integrated with Organizations. The organization management account
    designates the Detective administrator account for the organization. That
    account becomes the administrator account for the organization behavior
    graph. The Detective administrator account is also the delegated
    administrator account for Detective in Organizations.</p> <p>The Detective
    administrator account can enable any organization account as a member
    account in the organization behavior graph. The organization accounts do not
    receive invitations. The Detective administrator account can also invite
    other accounts to the organization behavior graph.</p> <p>Every behavior
    graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage behavior
    graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently
    selected endpoint.</p> <p>The administrator account for a behavior graph can
    use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Enable and
    disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.</p>
    </li> <li> <p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p>
    </li> <li> <p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li> <p>Apply
    tags to a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The organization management
    account can use the Detective API to select the delegated administrator for
    Detective.</p> <p>The Detective administrator account for an organization
    can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Perform all
    of the functions of an administrator account.</p> </li> <li> <p>Determine
    whether to automatically enable new organization accounts as member accounts
    in the organization behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>An invited member
    account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>View
    the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Remove their account from a behavior graph.</p> </li> </ul> <p>All API
    actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging
    Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p> <note> <p>We replaced the term
    "master account" with the term "administrator account." An administrator
    account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of
    Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior
    graph.</p> </note>

        <p>Creates a new behavior graph for the calling account, and sets that
        account as the administrator account. This operation is called by the
        account that is enabling Detective.</p> <p>Before you try to enable
        Detective, make sure that your account has been enrolled in Amazon
        GuardDuty for at least 48 hours. If you do not meet this requirement,
        you cannot enable Detective. If you do meet the GuardDuty prerequisite,
        then when you make the request to enable Detective, it checks whether
        your data volume is within the Detective quota. If it exceeds the quota,
        then you cannot enable Detective. </p> <p>The operation also enables
        Detective for the calling account in the currently selected Region. It
        returns the ARN of the new behavior graph.</p> <p>
        <code>CreateGraph</code> triggers a process to create the corresponding
        data tables for the new behavior graph.</p> <p>An account can only be
        the administrator account for one behavior graph within a Region. If the
        same account calls <code>CreateGraph</code> with the same administrator
        account, it always returns the same behavior graph ARN. It does not
        create a new behavior graph.</p>
  /graph/members:
    POST:
      summary: CreateMembers
      description: >-
        <p> <code>CreateMembers</code> is used to send invitations to accounts.
        For the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator account
        uses <code>CreateMembers</code> to enable organization accounts as
        member accounts.</p> <p>For invited accounts, <code>CreateMembers</code>
        sends a request to invite the specified Amazon Web Services accounts to
        be member accounts in the behavior graph. This operation can only be
        called by the administrator account for a behavior graph. </p> <p>
        <code>CreateMembers</code> verifies the accounts and then invites the
        verified accounts. The administrator can optionally specify to not send
        invitation emails to the member accounts. This would be used when the
        administrator manages their member accounts centrally.</p> <p>For
        organization accounts in the organization behavior graph,
        <code>CreateMembers</code> attempts to enable the accounts. The
        organization accounts do not receive invitations.</p> <p>The request
        provides the behavior graph ARN and the list of accounts to invite or to
        enable.</p> <p>The response separates the requested accounts into two
        lists:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The accounts that <code>CreateMembers</code> was
        able to process. For invited accounts, includes member accounts that are
        being verified, that have passed verification and are to be invited, and
        that have failed verification. For organization accounts in the
        organization behavior graph, includes accounts that can be enabled and
        that cannot be enabled.</p> </li> <li> <p>The accounts that
        <code>CreateMembers</code> was unable to process. This list includes
        accounts that were already invited to be member accounts in the behavior
        graph.</p> </li> </ul>
  /graph/removal:
    POST:
      summary: DeleteGraph
      description: >-
        <p>Disables the specified behavior graph and queues it to be deleted.
        This operation removes the behavior graph from each member account's
        list of behavior graphs.</p> <p> <code>DeleteGraph</code> can only be
        called by the administrator account for a behavior graph.</p>
  /graph/members/removal:
    POST:
      summary: DeleteMembers
      description: >-
        <p>Removes the specified member accounts from the behavior graph. The
        removed accounts no longer contribute data to the behavior graph. This
        operation can only be called by the administrator account for the
        behavior graph.</p> <p>For invited accounts, the removed accounts are
        deleted from the list of accounts in the behavior graph. To restore the
        account, the administrator account must send another invitation.</p>
        <p>For organization accounts in the organization behavior graph, the
        Detective administrator account can always enable the organization
        account again. Organization accounts that are not enabled as member
        accounts are not included in the <code>ListMembers</code> results for
        the organization behavior graph.</p> <p>An administrator account cannot
        use <code>DeleteMembers</code> to remove their own account from the
        behavior graph. To disable a behavior graph, the administrator account
        uses the <code>DeleteGraph</code> API method.</p>

  /orgs/disableAdminAccount:
    POST:
      summary: DisableOrganizationAdminAccount
      description: >-
        <p>Removes the Detective administrator account in the current Region.
        Deletes the organization behavior graph.</p> <p>Can only be called by
        the organization management account.</p> <p>Removing the Detective
        administrator account does not affect the delegated administrator
        account for Detective in Organizations.</p> <p>To remove the delegated
        administrator account in Organizations, use the Organizations API.
        Removing the delegated administrator account also removes the Detective
        administrator account in all Regions, except for Regions where the
        Detective administrator account is the organization management
        account.</p>
  /membership/removal:
    POST:
      summary: DisassociateMembership
      description: >-
        <p>Removes the member account from the specified behavior graph. This
        operation can only be called by an invited member account that has the
        <code>ENABLED</code> status.</p> <p> <code>DisassociateMembership</code>
        cannot be called by an organization account in the organization behavior
        graph. For the organization behavior graph, the Detective administrator
        account determines which organization accounts to enable or disable as
        member accounts.</p>
  /orgs/enableAdminAccount:
    POST:
      summary: EnableOrganizationAdminAccount
      description: >-
        <p>Designates the Detective administrator account for the organization
        in the current Region.</p> <p>If the account does not have Detective
        enabled, then enables Detective for that account and creates a new
        behavior graph.</p> <p>Can only be called by the organization management
        account.</p> <p>If the organization has a delegated administrator
        account in Organizations, then the Detective administrator account must
        be either the delegated administrator account or the organization
        management account.</p> <p>If the organization does not have a delegated
        administrator account in Organizations, then you can choose any account
        in the organization. If you choose an account other than the
        organization management account, Detective calls Organizations to make
        that account the delegated administrator account for Detective. The
        organization management account cannot be the delegated administrator
        account.</p>
