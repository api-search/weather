    <p/> <p>Amazon Managed Blockchain is a fully managed service for creating
    and managing blockchain networks using open-source frameworks. Blockchain
    allows you to build applications where multiple parties can securely and
    transparently run transactions and share data without the need for a
    trusted, central authority.</p> <p>Managed Blockchain supports the
    Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum open-source frameworks. Because of
    fundamental differences between the frameworks, some API actions or data
    types may only apply in the context of one framework and not the other. For
    example, actions related to Hyperledger Fabric network members such as
    <code>CreateMember</code> and <code>DeleteMember</code> don't apply to
    Ethereum.</p> <p>The description for each action indicates the framework or
    frameworks to which it applies. Data types and properties that apply only in
    the context of a particular framework are similarly indicated.</p>
