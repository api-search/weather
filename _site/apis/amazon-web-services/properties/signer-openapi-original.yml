    <p>AWS Signer is a fully managed code-signing service to help you ensure the
    trust and integrity of your code. </p> <p>Signer supports the following
    applications:</p> <p>With code signing for AWS Lambda, you can sign <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/">AWS Lambda</a>
    deployment packages. Integrated support is provided for <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/">Amazon S3</a>, <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/">Amazon
    CloudWatch</a>, and <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/">AWS
    CloudTrail</a>. In order to sign code, you create a signing profile and then
    use Signer to sign Lambda zip files in S3. </p> <p>With code signing for
    IoT, you can sign code for any IoT device that is supported by AWS. IoT code
    signing is available for <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/">Amazon
    FreeRTOS</a> and <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/">AWS IoT Device
    Management</a>, and is integrated with <a
    href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/">AWS Certificate
    Manager (ACM)</a>. In order to sign code, you import a third-party
    code-signing certificate using ACM, and use that to sign updates in Amazon
    FreeRTOS and AWS IoT Device Management. </p> <p>With Signer and the Notation
    CLI from the <a href="https://notaryproject.dev/">Notary&#x2028;
    Project</a>, you can sign container images stored in a container registry
    such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). The signatures are stored
    in the registry alongside the images, where they are available for verifying
    image authenticity and integrity.</p> <p>For more information about Signer,

    GET:
      summary: DescribeSigningJob
      description: >-
        <p>Returns information about a specific code signing job. You specify
        the job by using the <code>jobId</code> value that is returned by the
        <a>StartSigningJob</a> operation. </p>
  /revocations:
    GET:
      summary: GetRevocationStatus
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves the revocation status of one or more of the signing
        profile, signing job, and signing certificate.</p>

  /signing-jobs:
    POST:
      summary: StartSigningJob
      description: >-
        <p>Initiates a signing job to be performed on the code provided. Signing
        jobs are viewable by the <code>ListSigningJobs</code> operation for two
        years after they are performed. Note the following requirements: </p>
        <ul> <li> <p> You must create an Amazon S3 source bucket. For more
        information, see <a
        href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html">Creating
        a Bucket</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 Getting Started Guide</i>. </p> </li>
        <li> <p>Your S3 source bucket must be version enabled.</p> </li> <li>
        <p>You must create an S3 destination bucket. AWS Signer uses your S3
        destination bucket to write your signed code.</p> </li> <li> <p>You
        specify the name of the source and destination buckets when calling the
        <code>StartSigningJob</code> operation.</p> </li> <li> <p>You must also
        specify a request token that identifies your request to Signer.</p>
        </li> </ul> <p>You can call the <a>DescribeSigningJob</a> and the

        to use this action, see <a
