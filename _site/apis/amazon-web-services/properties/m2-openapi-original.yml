    <p>Amazon Web Services Mainframe Modernization provides tools and resources
    to help you plan and implement migration and modernization from mainframes
    to Amazon Web Services managed runtime environments. It provides tools for
    analyzing existing mainframe applications, developing or updating mainframe
    applications using COBOL or PL/I, and implementing an automated pipeline for
    continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) of the
    applications.</p>
