    <p>Amazon VPC Lattice is a fully managed application networking service that
    you use to connect, secure, and monitor all of your services across multiple
    accounts and virtual private clouds (VPCs). Amazon VPC Lattice interconnects
    your microservices and legacy services within a logical boundary, so that
    you can discover and manage them more efficiently. For more information, see
    the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/">Amazon VPC
    Lattice User Guide</a> </p>
