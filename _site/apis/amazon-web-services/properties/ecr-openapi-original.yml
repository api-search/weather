    <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Registry</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic
    Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a managed container image registry
    service. Customers can use the familiar Docker CLI, or their preferred
    client, to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a secure,
    scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container Initiative
    (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based
    permissions using IAM so that specific users or Amazon EC2 instances can
    access repositories and images.</p> <p>Amazon ECR has service endpoints in
    each supported Region. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/ecr.html">Amazon ECR
    endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
