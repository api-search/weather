      summary: UpdateQualificationType
      description: >-
        <p> The <code>UpdateQualificationType</code> operation modifies the
        attributes of an existing Qualification type, which is represented by a
        QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type
        can modify its attributes. </p> <p> Most attributes of a Qualification
        type can be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name
        and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds
        parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or to enable
        retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries. </p>
        <p> You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification
        type. The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test,
        TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters
        specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you
        must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The
        AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated
        test does not have an answer key. </p> <p> If you omit the Test
        parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no
        way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type
        already has a test, you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the
        Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an
        update, the type will henceforth have a test. </p> <p> If you want to
        update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without
        changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the
        original questions, along with the updated values. </p> <p> If you
        provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an
        answer key. Requests for such Qualifications must be granted manually.
        </p> <p> You can also update the AutoGranted and AutoGrantedValue
        attributes of the Qualification type.</p>
