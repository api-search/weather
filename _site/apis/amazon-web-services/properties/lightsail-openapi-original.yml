    <p>Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web
    Services (Amazon Web Services) for developers who need to build websites or
    web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your project
    quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage
    buckets, managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses,
    load balancers, content delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management
    of registered domains, and resource snapshots (backups) - for a low,
    predictable monthly price.</p> <p>You can manage your Lightsail resources
    using the Lightsail console, Lightsail API, Command Line Interface (CLI), or
    SDKs. For more information about Lightsail concepts and tasks, see the <a
    href="https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/lightsail-how-to-set-up-access-keys-to-use-sdk-api-cli">Amazon
    Lightsail Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>This API Reference provides detailed
    information about the actions, data types, parameters, and errors of the
    Lightsail service. For more information about the supported Amazon Web
    Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of the Lightsail service,
    see <a

      summary: UpdateRelationalDatabaseParameters
      description: >-
        <p>Allows the update of one or more parameters of a database in Amazon
        Lightsail.</p> <p>Parameter updates don't cause outages; therefore,
        their application is not subject to the preferred maintenance window.
        However, there are two ways in which parameter updates are applied:
        <code>dynamic</code> or <code>pending-reboot</code>. Parameters marked
        with a <code>dynamic</code> apply type are applied immediately.
        Parameters marked with a <code>pending-reboot</code> apply type are
        applied only after the database is rebooted using the <code>reboot
        relational database</code> operation.</p> <p>The <code>update relational
        database parameters</code> operation supports tag-based access control
        via resource tags applied to the resource identified by
        relationalDatabaseName. For more information, see the <a
