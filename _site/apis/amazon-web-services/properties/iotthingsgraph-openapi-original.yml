    <fullname>AWS IoT Things Graph</fullname> <p>AWS IoT Things Graph provides
    an integrated set of tools that enable developers to connect devices and
    services that use different standards, such as units of measure and
    communication protocols. AWS IoT Things Graph makes it possible to build IoT
    applications with little to no code by connecting devices and services and
    defining how they interact at an abstract level.</p> <p>For more information
    about how AWS IoT Things Graph works, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/thingsgraph/latest/ug/iot-tg-whatis.html">User
    Guide</a>.</p> <p>The AWS IoT Things Graph service is discontinued.</p>

      summary: UploadEntityDefinitions
      description: >-
        <p>Asynchronously uploads one or more entity definitions to the user's
        namespace. The <code>document</code> parameter is required if
        <code>syncWithPublicNamespace</code> and
        <code>deleteExistingEntites</code> are false. If the
        <code>syncWithPublicNamespace</code> parameter is set to
        <code>true</code>, the user's namespace will synchronize with the latest
        version of the public namespace. If
        <code>deprecateExistingEntities</code> is set to true, all entities in
        the latest version will be deleted before the new
        <code>DefinitionDocument</code> is uploaded.</p> <p>When a user uploads
        entity definitions for the first time, the service creates a new
        namespace for the user. The new namespace tracks the public namespace.
        Currently users can have only one namespace. The namespace version
        increments whenever a user uploads entity definitions that are
        backwards-incompatible and whenever a user sets the
        <code>syncWithPublicNamespace</code> parameter or the
        <code>deprecateExistingEntities</code> parameter to
        <code>true</code>.</p> <p>The IDs for all of the entities should be in
        URN format. Each entity must be in the user's namespace. Users can't
        create entities in the public namespace, but entity definitions can
        refer to entities in the public namespace.</p> <p>Valid entities are
        <code>Device</code>, <code>DeviceModel</code>, <code>Service</code>,
        <code>Capability</code>, <code>State</code>, <code>Action</code>,
        <code>Event</code>, <code>Property</code>, <code>Mapping</code>,
        <code>Enum</code>. </p>
