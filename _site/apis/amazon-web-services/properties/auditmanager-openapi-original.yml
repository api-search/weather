    <p>Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers
    who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data
    types, and errors. </p> <p>Audit Manager is a service that provides
    automated evidence collection so that you can continually audit your Amazon
    Web Services usage. You can use it to assess the effectiveness of your
    controls, manage risk, and simplify compliance.</p> <p>Audit Manager
    provides prebuilt frameworks that structure and automate assessments for a
    given compliance standard. Frameworks include a prebuilt collection of
    controls with descriptions and testing procedures. These controls are
    grouped according to the requirements of the specified compliance standard
    or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls to support
    internal audits with specific requirements. </p> <p>Use the following links

        <p>Deletes an assessment report in Audit Manager. </p> <p>When you run
        the <code>DeleteAssessmentReport</code> operation, Audit Manager
        attempts to delete the following data:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The specified
        assessment report that’s stored in your S3 bucket</p> </li> <li> <p>The
        associated metadata that’s stored in Audit Manager</p> </li> </ol> <p>If
        Audit Manager can’t access the assessment report in your S3 bucket, the
        report isn’t deleted. In this event, the
        <code>DeleteAssessmentReport</code> operation doesn’t fail. Instead, it
        proceeds to delete the associated metadata only. You must then delete
        the assessment report from the S3 bucket yourself. </p> <p>This scenario
        happens when Audit Manager receives a <code>403 (Forbidden)</code> or
        <code>404 (Not Found)</code> error from Amazon S3. To avoid this, make
        sure that your S3 bucket is available, and that you configured the
        correct permissions for Audit Manager to delete resources in your S3
        bucket. For an example permissions policy that you can use, see <a

        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateSettings.html">UpdateSettings</a>
        API operation to set your preferred data retention policy. By default,
        Audit Manager retains your data. If you want to delete your data, you
        can use the <code>DeregistrationPolicy</code> attribute to request the
        deletion of your data. </p> <p>For more information about data
        retention, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/audit-manager/latest/userguide/data-protection.html">Data
        Protection</a> in the <i>Audit Manager User Guide</i>. </p> </note>
  /account/deregisterOrganizationAdminAccount:
    POST:
      summary: DeregisterOrganizationAdminAccount
      description: >-
        <p>Removes the specified Amazon Web Services account as a delegated
        administrator for Audit Manager. </p> <p>When you remove a delegated
        administrator from your Audit Manager settings, you continue to have
        access to the evidence that you previously collected under that account.
        This is also the case when you deregister a delegated administrator from
        Organizations. However, Audit Manager stops collecting and attaching
        evidence to that delegated administrator account moving forward.</p>
        <important> <p>Keep in mind the following cleanup task if you use
        evidence finder:</p> <p>Before you use your management account to remove
        a delegated administrator, make sure that the current delegated
        administrator account signs in to Audit Manager and disables evidence
        finder first. Disabling evidence finder automatically deletes the event
        data store that was created in their account when they enabled evidence
        finder. If this task isn’t completed, the event data store remains in
        their account. In this case, we recommend that the original delegated
        administrator goes to CloudTrail Lake and manually <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/query-eds-disable-termination.html">deletes
        the event data store</a>.</p> <p>This cleanup task is necessary to
        ensure that you don't end up with multiple event data stores. Audit
        Manager ignores an unused event data store after you remove or change a
        delegated administrator account. However, the unused event data store
        continues to incur storage costs from CloudTrail Lake if you don't
        delete it.</p> </important> <p>When you deregister a delegated
        administrator account for Audit Manager, the data for that account isn’t
        deleted. If you want to delete resource data for a delegated
        administrator account, you must perform that task separately before you
        deregister the account. Either, you can do this in the Audit Manager
        console. Or, you can use one of the delete API operations that are
        provided by Audit Manager. </p> <p>To delete your Audit Manager resource
        data, see the following instructions: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a
