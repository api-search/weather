    Elastic Container Registry Public (Amazon ECR Public) is a managed container
    image registry service. Amazon ECR provides both public and private
    registries to host your container images. You can use the Docker CLI or your
    preferred client to push, pull, and manage images. Amazon ECR provides a
    secure, scalable, and reliable registry for your Docker or Open Container
    Initiative (OCI) images. Amazon ECR supports public repositories with this
    API. For information about the Amazon ECR API for private repositories, see

    Elastic Container Registry API Reference</a>.</p>

        <p>Uploads an image layer part to Amazon ECR.</p> <p>When an image is
        pushed, each new image layer is uploaded in parts. The maximum size of
        each image layer part can be 20971520 bytes (about 20MB). The
        UploadLayerPart API is called once for each new image layer part.</p>
        <note> <p>This operation is used by the Amazon ECR proxy and is not
        generally used by customers for pulling and pushing images. In most
        cases, you should use the <code>docker</code> CLI to pull, tag, and push
        images.</p> </note>
