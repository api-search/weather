    <p>Use AppConfig, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager, to
    create, manage, and quickly deploy application configurations. AppConfig
    supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes
    built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with
    applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, Lambda, containers, mobile
    applications, or IoT devices.</p> <p>To prevent errors when deploying
    application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple
    typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A
    validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the
    configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your
    application configuration data, you provide a schema or an Amazon Web
    Services Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The
    configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration
    data is valid.</p> <p>During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors
    the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system
    encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for
    your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each
    application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including
    velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if
    a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the
    previous version. </p> <p>AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are
    some examples:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Feature flags</b>: Use AppConfig to turn
    on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch
    or announcement. </p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Application tuning</b>: Use
    AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only
    be tested with production traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Allow list</b>: Use
    AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. </p> </li>
    <li> <p> <b>Operational issues</b>: Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your
    application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the
    system.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This reference is intended to be used with the <a
