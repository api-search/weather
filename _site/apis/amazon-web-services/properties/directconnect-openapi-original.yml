    <p>Direct Connect links your internal network to an Direct Connect location
    over a standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is
    connected to your router, the other to an Direct Connect router. With this
    connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the
    Amazon Web Services Cloud (for example, to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3) and to
    Amazon VPC, bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. A
    connection provides access to all Amazon Web Services Regions except the
    China (Beijing) and (China) Ningxia Regions. Amazon Web Services resources
    in the China Regions can only be accessed through locations associated with
    those Regions.</p>

        <p>Updates the specified attributes of the specified virtual private
        interface.</p> <p>Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo
        frames) can cause an update to the underlying physical connection if it
        wasn't updated to support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts
        network connectivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the
        connection for up to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection
        supports jumbo frames, call <a>DescribeConnections</a>. To check whether
        your virtual interface supports jumbo frames, call
        <a>DescribeVirtualInterfaces</a>.</p>
