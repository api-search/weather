    <fullname>Amazon Elastic File System</fullname> <p>Amazon Elastic File
    System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with
    Amazon EC2 Linux and Mac instances in the Amazon Web Services Cloud. With
    Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically
    as you add and remove files, so that your applications have the storage they
    need, when they need it. For more information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html">Amazon
    Elastic File System API Reference</a> and the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/whatisefs.html">Amazon
    Elastic File System User Guide</a>.</p>
paths:
  /2015-02-01/access-points:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeAccessPoints
      description: >-
        <p>Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS access point if the
        <code>AccessPointId</code> is provided. If you provide an EFS
        <code>FileSystemId</code>, it returns descriptions of all access points
        for that file system. You can provide either an
        <code>AccessPointId</code> or a <code>FileSystemId</code> in the
        request, but not both. </p> <p>This operation requires permissions for
        the <code>elasticfilesystem:DescribeAccessPoints</code> action.</p>
  /2015-02-01/file-systems:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeFileSystems
      description: >-
        <p>Returns the description of a specific Amazon EFS file system if
        either the file system <code>CreationToken</code> or the
        <code>FileSystemId</code> is provided. Otherwise, it returns
        descriptions of all file systems owned by the caller's Amazon Web
        Services account in the Amazon Web Services Region of the endpoint that
        you're calling.</p> <p>When retrieving all file system descriptions, you
        can optionally specify the <code>MaxItems</code> parameter to limit the
        number of descriptions in a response. This number is automatically set
        to 100. If more file system descriptions remain, Amazon EFS returns a
        <code>NextMarker</code>, an opaque token, in the response. In this case,
        you should send a subsequent request with the <code>Marker</code>
        request parameter set to the value of <code>NextMarker</code>. </p>
        <p>To retrieve a list of your file system descriptions, this operation
        is used in an iterative process, where <code>DescribeFileSystems</code>
        is called first without the <code>Marker</code> and then the operation
        continues to call it with the <code>Marker</code> parameter set to the
        value of the <code>NextMarker</code> from the previous response until
        the response has no <code>NextMarker</code>. </p> <p> The order of file
        systems returned in the response of one <code>DescribeFileSystems</code>
        call and the order of file systems returned across the responses of a
        multi-call iteration is unspecified. </p> <p> This operation requires
        permissions for the <code>elasticfilesystem:DescribeFileSystems</code>
        action. </p>
  /2015-02-01/mount-targets:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeMountTargets
      description: >-
        <p>Returns the descriptions of all the current mount targets, or a
        specific mount target, for a file system. When requesting all of the
        current mount targets, the order of mount targets returned in the
        response is unspecified.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions for
        the <code>elasticfilesystem:DescribeMountTargets</code> action, on
        either the file system ID that you specify in <code>FileSystemId</code>,
        or on the file system of the mount target that you specify in
        <code>MountTargetId</code>.</p>

    DELETE:
      summary: DeleteReplicationConfiguration
      description: >-
        <p>Deletes a replication configuration. Deleting a replication
        configuration ends the replication process. After a replication
        configuration is deleted, the destination file system becomes
        <code>Writeable</code> and its replication overwrite protection is
        re-enabled. For more information, see <a

        maintained. To create tags for EFS resources, use the API action.</p>
        </note> <p>Creates or overwrites tags associated with a file system.
        Each tag is a key-value pair. If a tag key specified in the request
        already exists on the file system, this operation overwrites its value
        with the value provided in the request. If you add the <code>Name</code>
        tag to your file system, Amazon EFS returns it in the response to the
        <a>DescribeFileSystems</a> operation. </p> <p>This operation requires

      description: >-
        <p>Applies an Amazon EFS <code>FileSystemPolicy</code> to an Amazon EFS

        can contain multiple policy statements. A file system always has exactly
        one file system policy, which can be the default policy or an explicit
        policy set or updated using this API operation. EFS file system policies
        have a 20,000 character limit. When an explicit policy is set, it
        overrides the default policy. For more information about the default
        file system policy, see <a

    DELETE:
      summary: DeleteMountTarget
      description: >-
        <p>Deletes the specified mount target.</p> <p>This operation forcibly
        breaks any mounts of the file system by using the mount target that is
        being deleted, which might disrupt instances or applications using those
        mounts. To avoid applications getting cut off abruptly, you might
        consider unmounting any mounts of the mount target, if feasible. The
        operation also deletes the associated network interface. Uncommitted
        writes might be lost, but breaking a mount target using this operation
        does not corrupt the file system itself. The file system you created
        remains. You can mount an EC2 instance in your VPC by using another
        mount target.</p> <p>This operation requires permissions for the
        following action on the file system:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
        <code>elasticfilesystem:DeleteMountTarget</code> </p> </li> </ul> <note>
        <p>The <code>DeleteMountTarget</code> call returns while the mount
        target state is still <code>deleting</code>. You can check the mount
        target deletion by calling the <a>DescribeMountTargets</a> operation,
        which returns a list of mount target descriptions for the given file
        system. </p> </note> <p>The operation also requires permissions for the
        following Amazon EC2 action on the mount target's network interface:</p>
        <ul> <li> <p> <code>ec2:DeleteNetworkInterface</code> </p> </li> </ul>

        </note> <p>Deletes the specified tags from a file system. If the
        <code>DeleteTags</code> request includes a tag key that doesn't exist,
        Amazon EFS ignores it and doesn't cause an error. For more information

        character (32 bit) resource IDs for new EFS file system and mount target
        resources. All existing resource IDs are not affected by any changes you
        make. You can set the ID preference during the opt-in period as EFS
        transitions to long resource IDs. For more information, see <a

        system from their current storage class (either IA or Standard storage)
        into the Archive storage.</p> <p>File systems cannot transition into
        Archive storage before transitioning into IA storage. Therefore,
        TransitionToArchive must either not be set or must be later than
        TransitionToIA.</p> <note> <p> The Archive storage class is available

        Managing file system storage</a>.</p> <p>Each Amazon EFS file system
        supports one lifecycle configuration, which applies to all files in the

        exists for the specified file system, a
        <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> call modifies the existing
        configuration. A <code>PutLifecycleConfiguration</code> call with an
        empty <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> array in the request body deletes
        any existing <code>LifecycleConfiguration</code>. In the request,
        specify the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The ID for the file system for
        which you are enabling, disabling, or modifying Lifecycle
        management.</p> </li> <li> <p>A <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> array of
        <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> objects that define when to move files to
        IA storage, to Archive storage, and back to primary storage.</p> <note>
        <p>Amazon EFS requires that each <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> object
        have only have a single transition, so the
        <code>LifecyclePolicies</code> array needs to be structured with
        separate <code>LifecyclePolicy</code> objects. See the example requests
