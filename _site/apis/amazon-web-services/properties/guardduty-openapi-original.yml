  description: >-
    <p>Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that
    analyzes and processes the following foundational data sources - VPC flow
    logs, Amazon Web Services CloudTrail management event logs, CloudTrail S3
    data event logs, EKS audit logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, runtime
    activity belonging to container workloads, such as Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS
    (including Amazon Web Services Fargate), and Amazon EC2 instances. It uses
    threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IPs and domains, and
    machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and
    malicious activity within your Amazon Web Services environment. This can
    include issues like escalations of privileges, uses of exposed credentials,
    or communication with malicious IPs, domains, or presence of malware on your
    Amazon EC2 instances and container workloads. For example, GuardDuty can
    detect compromised EC2 instances and container workloads serving malware, or
    mining bitcoin. </p> <p>GuardDuty also monitors Amazon Web Services account
    access behavior for signs of compromise, such as unauthorized infrastructure
    deployments like EC2 instances deployed in a Region that has never been
    used, or unusual API calls like a password policy change to reduce password
    strength. </p> <p>GuardDuty informs you about the status of your Amazon Web
    Services environment by producing security findings that you can view in the
    GuardDuty console or through Amazon EventBridge. For more information, see
    the <i> <a
