    <p>Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB) Query provides you with convenient access
    to multi-blockchain network data, which makes it easier for you to extract
    contextual data related to blockchain activity. You can use AMB Query to
    read data from public blockchain networks, such as Bitcoin Mainnet and
    Ethereum Mainnet. You can also get information such as the current and
    historical balances of addresses, or you can get a list of blockchain
    transactions for a given time period. Additionally, you can get details of a
    given transaction, such as transaction events, which you can further analyze
    or use in business logic for your applications.</p>
