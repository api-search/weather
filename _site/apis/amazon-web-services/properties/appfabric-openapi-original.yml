    <p>Amazon Web Services AppFabric quickly connects software as a service
    (SaaS) applications across your organization. This allows IT and security
    teams to easily manage and secure applications using a standard schema, and
    employees can complete everyday tasks faster using generative artificial
    intelligence (AI). You can use these APIs to complete AppFabric tasks, such
    as setting up audit log ingestions or viewing user access. For more
    information about AppFabric, including the required permissions to use the
    service, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appfabric/latest/adminguide/">Amazon Web
    Services AppFabric Administration Guide</a>. For more information about
    using the Command Line Interface (CLI) to manage your AppFabric resources,
    see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/appfabric/index.html">AppFabric
    section of the CLI Reference</a>.</p>
