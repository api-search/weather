    <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager
    supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web
    Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log
    files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by
    Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully
    made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on.
    For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon
    Web Services CloudTrail, see <a

    Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services
    CloudTrail</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide</i>.

      summary: ValidateResourcePolicy
      description: >-
        <p>Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of
        principals access to your secret. A resource-based policy is optional
        for secrets.</p> <p>The API performs three checks when validating the
        policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Sends a call to <a
        href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/protect-sensitive-data-in-the-cloud-with-automated-reasoning-zelkova/">Zelkova</a>,
        an automated reasoning engine, to ensure your resource policy does not
        allow broad access to your secret, for example policies that use a
        wildcard for the principal.</p> </li> <li> <p>Checks for correct syntax
        in a policy.</p> </li> <li> <p>Verifies the policy does not lock out a
        caller.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Secrets Manager generates a CloudTrail log
        entry when you call this action. Do not include sensitive information in
        request parameters because it might be logged. For more information, see
