    <fullname>Database Migration Service</fullname> <p>Database Migration
    Service (DMS) can migrate your data to and from the most widely used
    commercial and open-source databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft
    SQL Server, Amazon Redshift, MariaDB, Amazon Aurora, MySQL, and SAP Adaptive
    Server Enterprise (ASE). The service supports homogeneous migrations such as
    Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different
    database platforms, such as Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to PostgreSQL.</p>

    Database Migration Service?</a> in the <i>Database Migration Service User

      summary: UpdateSubscriptionsToEventBridge
      description: >-
        <p>Migrates 10 active and enabled Amazon SNS subscriptions at a time and
        converts them to corresponding Amazon EventBridge rules. By default,
        this operation migrates subscriptions only when all your replication
        instance versions are 3.4.5 or higher. If any replication instances are
        from versions earlier than 3.4.5, the operation raises an error and
        tells you to upgrade these instances to version 3.4.5 or higher. To
        enable migration regardless of version, set the <code>Force</code>
        option to true. However, if you don't upgrade instances earlier than
        version 3.4.5, some types of events might not be available when you use
        Amazon EventBridge.</p> <p>To call this operation, make sure that you
        have certain permissions added to your user account. For more
        information, see <a
