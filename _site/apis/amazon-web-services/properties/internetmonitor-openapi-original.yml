    <p>Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor provides visibility into how internet
    issues impact the performance and availability between your applications
    hosted on Amazon Web Services and your end users. It can reduce the time it
    takes for you to diagnose internet issues from days to minutes. Internet
    Monitor uses the connectivity data that Amazon Web Services captures from
    its global networking footprint to calculate a baseline of performance and
    availability for internet traffic. This is the same data that Amazon Web
    Services uses to monitor internet uptime and availability. With those
    measurements as a baseline, Internet Monitor raises awareness for you when
    there are significant problems for your end users in the different
    geographic locations where your application runs.</p> <p>Internet Monitor
    publishes internet measurements to CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Metrics,
    to easily support using CloudWatch tools with health information for
    geographies and networks specific to your application. Internet Monitor
    sends health events to Amazon EventBridge so that you can set up
    notifications. If an issue is caused by the Amazon Web Services network, you
    also automatically receive an Amazon Web Services Health Dashboard
    notification with the steps that Amazon Web Services is taking to mitigate
    the problem.</p> <p>To use Internet Monitor, you create a <i>monitor</i> and
    associate your application's resources with it - VPCs, NLBs, CloudFront
    distributions, or WorkSpaces directories - so Internet Monitor can determine
    where your application's internet traffic is. Internet Monitor then provides
    internet measurements from Amazon Web Services that are specific to the
    locations and ASNs (typically, internet service providers or ISPs) that
    communicate with your application.</p> <p>For more information, see <a

    GET:
      summary: ListMonitors
      description: >-
        <p>Lists all of your monitors for Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor and
        their statuses, along with the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and name of
        each monitor.</p>
  /v20210603/Monitors/{MonitorName}:
    PATCH:
      summary: UpdateMonitor
      description: >-
        <p>Updates a monitor. You can update a monitor to change the percentage
        of traffic to monitor or the maximum number of city-networks (locations
        and ASNs), to add or remove resources, or to change the status of the
        monitor. Note that you can't change the name of a monitor.</p> <p>The
        city-network maximum that you choose is the limit, but you only pay for
        the number of city-networks that are actually monitored. For more
        information, see <a
