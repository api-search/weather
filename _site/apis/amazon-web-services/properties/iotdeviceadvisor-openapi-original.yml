    <p>Amazon Web Services IoT Core Device Advisor is a cloud-based, fully
    managed test capability for validating IoT devices during device software
    development. Device Advisor provides pre-built tests that you can use to
    validate IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with Amazon Web
    Services IoT Core before deploying devices to production. By using Device
    Advisor, you can confirm that your devices can connect to Amazon Web
    Services IoT Core, follow security best practices and, if applicable,
    receive software updates from IoT Device Management. You can also download
    signed qualification reports to submit to the Amazon Web Services Partner
    Network to get your device qualified for the Amazon Web Services Partner
    Device Catalog without the need to send your device in and wait for it to be
    tested.</p>
