    <p>Amazon EventBridge helps you to respond to state changes in your Amazon
    Web Services resources. When your resources change state, they automatically
    send events to an event stream. You can create rules that match selected
    events in the stream and route them to targets to take action. You can also
    use rules to take action on a predetermined schedule. For example, you can
    configure rules to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Automatically invoke an Lambda function
    to update DNS entries when an event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance
    enters the running state.</p> </li> <li> <p>Direct specific API records from
    CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis data stream for detailed analysis of
    potential security or availability risks.</p> </li> <li> <p>Periodically
    invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS volume.</p>
    </li> </ul> <p>For more information about the features of Amazon
    EventBridge, see the <a
