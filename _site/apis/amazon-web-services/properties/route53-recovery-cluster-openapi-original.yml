    <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for
    Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53 ARC,
    you can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover applications
    by rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services
    Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a highly
    available cluster in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five
    redundant Regional endpoints against which you can run API calls to get or
    update the state of routing controls. To implement failover, you set one
    routing control to ON and another one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one
    Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be
    aware that you must specify a Regional endpoint for a cluster when you work
    with API cluster operations to get or update routing control states in Route
    53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region for
    Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the parameter <code>--region
    us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more information, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
    Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route
    53 Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API guide
    includes information about the API operations for how to get and update
    routing control states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in
    Route 53 ARC, you must first create the required components (clusters,
    control panels, and routing controls) using the recovery cluster
    configuration API.</p> <p>For more information about working with routing
    control in Route 53 ARC, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create
    clusters, control panels, and routing controls by using API operations. For

    Recovery Controller</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn about the components in
    recovery control, including clusters, routing controls, and control panels,
    and how to work with Route 53 ARC in the Amazon Web Services console. For

    readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that
    your applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more

        <p>Set multiple routing control states. You can set the value for each
        state to be ON or OFF. When the state is ON, traffic flows to a cell.
        When it's OFF, traffic does not flow.</p> <p>With Route 53 ARC, you can
        add safety rules for routing controls, which are safeguards for routing
        control state updates that help prevent unexpected outcomes, like fail
        open traffic routing. However, there are scenarios when you might want
        to bypass the routing control safeguards that are enforced with safety
        rules that you've configured. For example, you might want to fail over
        quickly for disaster recovery, and one or more safety rules might be
        unexpectedly preventing you from updating a routing control state to
        reroute traffic. In a "break glass" scenario like this, you can override
        one or more safety rules to change a routing control state and fail over
        your application.</p> <p>The <code>SafetyRulesToOverride</code> property
        enables you override one or more safety rules and update routing control
        states. For more information, see <a
