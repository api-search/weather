    <fullname>Amazon WorkSpaces Service</fullname> <p>Amazon WorkSpaces enables
    you to provision virtual, cloud-based Microsoft Windows or Amazon Linux
    desktops for your users, known as <i>WorkSpaces</i>. WorkSpaces eliminates
    the need to procure and deploy hardware or install complex software. You can
    quickly add or remove users as your needs change. Users can access their
    virtual desktops from multiple devices or web browsers.</p> <p>This API
    Reference provides detailed information about the actions, data types,
    parameters, and errors of the WorkSpaces service. For more information about
    the supported Amazon Web Services Regions, endpoints, and service quotas of
    the Amazon WorkSpaces service, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/wsp.html">WorkSpaces
    endpoints and quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General
    Reference</i>.</p> <p>You can also manage your WorkSpaces resources using
    the WorkSpaces console, Command Line Interface (CLI), and SDKs. For more
    information about administering WorkSpaces, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/">Amazon

    WorkSpaces, see the <a
