    <fullname>Elastic Load Balancing</fullname> <p>A load balancer distributes
    incoming traffic across targets, such as your EC2 instances. This enables
    you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also
    monitors the health of its registered targets and ensures that it routes
    traffic only to healthy targets. You configure your load balancer to accept
    incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured
    with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load
    balancer. You configure a target group with a protocol and port number for
    connections from the load balancer to the targets, and with health check
    settings to be used when checking the health status of the targets.</p>
    <p>Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers:
    Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers,
    and Classic Load Balancers. This reference covers the following load
    balancer types:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Application Load Balancer - Operates at the
    application layer (layer 7) and supports HTTP and HTTPS.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>Network Load Balancer - Operates at the transport layer (layer 4) and
    supports TCP, TLS, and UDP.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gateway Load Balancer -
    Operates at the network layer (layer 3).</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more
    information, see the <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/">Elastic
    Load Balancing User Guide</a>.</p> <p>All Elastic Load Balancing operations
    are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you
    repeat an operation, it succeeds.</p>

        <p>Enables the Availability Zones for the specified public subnets for
        the specified Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer or
        Gateway Load Balancer. The specified subnets replace the previously

        Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer you must include all subnets that
        were enabled previously, with their existing configurations, plus any
        additional subnets.</p>
