    <fullname>Amazon Pinpoint Email Service</fullname> <p>Welcome to the
    <i>Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference</i>. This guide provides information
    about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported
    operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.</p> <p> <a
    href="https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint">Amazon Pinpoint</a> is an AWS service
    that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging
    channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages,
    voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API
    provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel
    and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.</p> <p>If
    you're new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the
    <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/latest/developerguide/welcome.html">Amazon
    Pinpoint Developer Guide</a>. The <i>Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide</i>
    provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to use
    Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon
    Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications. The
    guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint
    integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the
    service.</p> <p>The Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS
    Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of
    all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#pinpoint_region">AWS
    Service Endpoints</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.
    To learn more about AWS Regions, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html">Managing
    AWS Regions</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i>.</p>
    <p>In each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These
    Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united
    by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network
    connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels
    of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more
    about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region,

      description: >-
        <p>List all of the configuration sets associated with your Amazon
        Pinpoint account in the current region.</p> <p>In Amazon Pinpoint,
        <i>configuration sets</i> are groups of rules that you can apply to the
        emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including
        a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When
        you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that
        configuration set are applied to the email.</p>

        configuration set.</p> <p>In Amazon Pinpoint, <i>events</i> include
        message sends, deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, and complaints.
        <i>Event destinations</i> are places that you can send information about
        these events to. For example, you can send event data to Amazon SNS to

        <p>Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox
        placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled
        by various email providers around the world. When you perform a
        predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that
        contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon
        Pinpoint then sends that message to special email addresses spread
        across several major email providers. After about 24 hours, the test is
        complete, and you can use the <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code>
        operation to view the results of the test.</p>
