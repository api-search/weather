    <p>Transfer Family is a fully managed service that enables the transfer of
    files over the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), File Transfer Protocol over SSL
    (FTPS), or Secure Shell (SSH) File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) directly into
    and out of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) or Amazon EFS.
    Additionally, you can use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) to transfer files
    into and out of Amazon S3. Amazon Web Services helps you seamlessly migrate
    your file transfer workflows to Transfer Family by integrating with existing
    authentication systems, and providing DNS routing with Amazon Route 53 so
    nothing changes for your customers and partners, or their applications. With
    your data in Amazon S3, you can use it with Amazon Web Services for
    processing, analytics, machine learning, and archiving. Getting started with
    Transfer Family is easy since there is no infrastructure to buy and set
    up.</p>
