    <fullname>Cloud Map</fullname> <p>With Cloud Map, you can configure public
    DNS, private DNS, or HTTP namespaces that your microservice applications run
    in. When an instance becomes available, you can call the Cloud Map API to
    register the instance with Cloud Map. For public or private DNS namespaces,
    Cloud Map automatically creates DNS records and an optional health check.
    Clients that submit public or private DNS queries, or HTTP requests, for the
    service receive an answer that contains up to eight healthy records. </p>
