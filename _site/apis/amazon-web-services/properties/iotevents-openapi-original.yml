    <p>AWS IoT Events monitors your equipment or device fleets for failures or
    changes in operation, and triggers actions when such events occur. You can
    use AWS IoT Events API operations to create, read, update, and delete inputs
    and detector models, and to list their versions.</p>
paths:
  /alarm-models:
    GET:
      summary: ListAlarmModels
      description: >-
        <p>Lists the alarm models that you created. The operation returns only
        the metadata associated with each alarm model.</p>
  /detector-models:
    GET:
      summary: ListDetectorModels
      description: >-
        <p>Lists the detector models you have created. Only the metadata
        associated with each detector model is returned.</p>
  /inputs:
    GET:
      summary: ListInputs
      description: <p>Lists the inputs you have created.</p>
  /alarm-models/{alarmModelName}:
    POST:
      summary: UpdateAlarmModel
      description: >-
        <p>Updates an alarm model. Any alarms that were created based on the
        previous version are deleted and then created again as new data
        arrives.</p>
  /detector-models/{detectorModelName}:
    POST:
      summary: UpdateDetectorModel
      description: >-
        <p>Updates a detector model. Detectors (instances) spawned by the
        previous version are deleted and then re-created as new inputs
        arrive.</p>
  /inputs/{inputName}:
    PUT:
      summary: UpdateInput
      description: <p>Updates an input.</p>
  /analysis/detector-models/{analysisId}:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeDetectorModelAnalysis
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves runtime information about a detector model analysis.</p>
        <note> <p>After AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you
        have up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.</p> </note>
  /logging:
    PUT:
      summary: PutLoggingOptions
      description: >-
        <p>Sets or updates the AWS IoT Events logging options.</p> <p>If you
        update the value of any <code>loggingOptions</code> field, it takes up
        to one minute for the change to take effect. If you change the policy
        attached to the role you specified in the <code>roleArn</code> field
        (for example, to correct an invalid policy), it takes up to five minutes
        for that change to take effect.</p>
  /analysis/detector-models/{analysisId}/results:
    GET:
      summary: GetDetectorModelAnalysisResults
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves one or more analysis results of the detector model.</p>
        <note> <p>After AWS IoT Events starts analyzing your detector model, you
        have up to 24 hours to retrieve the analysis results.</p> </note>
  /alarm-models/{alarmModelName}/versions:
    GET:
      summary: ListAlarmModelVersions
      description: >-
        <p>Lists all the versions of an alarm model. The operation returns only
        the metadata associated with each alarm model version.</p>
  /detector-models/{detectorModelName}/versions:
    GET:
      summary: ListDetectorModelVersions
      description: >-
        <p>Lists all the versions of a detector model. Only the metadata
        associated with each detector model version is returned.</p>
  /input-routings:
    POST:
      summary: ListInputRoutings
      description: <p> Lists one or more input routings. </p>
  /tags:
    DELETE:
      summary: UntagResource
      description: <p>Removes the given tags (metadata) from the resource.</p>
  /analysis/detector-models/:
    POST:
      summary: StartDetectorModelAnalysis
      description: >-
        <p>Performs an analysis of your detector model. For more information,
