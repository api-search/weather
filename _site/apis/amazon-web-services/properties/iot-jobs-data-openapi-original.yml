    <p>AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€”
    remote operations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices
    connected to AWS IoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set
    of devices to download and install application or firmware updates, reboot,
    rotate certificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.</p> <p>
    To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the
    remote operations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that
    should perform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing
    groups or both.</p> <p> AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets
    that a job is available. The target starts the execution of the job by
    downloading the job document, performing the operations it specifies, and
    reporting its progress to AWS IoT. The Jobs service provides commands to
    track the progress of a job on a specific target and for all the targets of
    the job</p>
