    <p>Amazon Connect is a cloud-based contact center solution that you use to
    set up and manage a customer contact center and provide reliable customer
    engagement at any scale.</p> <p>Amazon Connect provides metrics and
    real-time reporting that enable you to optimize contact routing. You can
    also resolve customer issues more efficiently by getting customers in touch
    with the appropriate agents.</p> <p>There are limits to the number of Amazon
    Connect resources that you can create. There are also limits to the number
    of requests that you can make per second. For more information, see <a

    Connect Service Quotas</a> in the <i>Amazon Connect Administrator
    Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can connect programmatically to an Amazon Web Services
    service by using an endpoint. For a list of Amazon Connect endpoints, see <a

        API. It then uses BatchPutContact to create contacts corresponding to
        those dial requests. If agents are available, the dial requests are
        dialed out, which results in a voice call. The resulting voice call uses
        the same contactId that was created by BatchPutContact. </p>

        operation.</p> </important> <p>If you plan to claim and release numbers
        frequently during a 30 day period, contact us for a service quota
        exception. Otherwise, it is possible you will be blocked from claiming
        and releasing any more numbers until 30 days past the oldest number
        released has expired.</p> <p>By default you can claim and release up to
        200% of your maximum number of active phone numbers during any 30 day
        period. If you claim and release phone numbers using the UI or API
        during a rolling 30 day cycle that exceeds 200% of your phone number
        service level quota, you will be blocked from claiming any more numbers
        until 30 days past the oldest number released has expired. </p> <p>For
        example, if you already have 99 claimed numbers and a service level
        quota of 99 phone numbers, and in any 30 day period you release 99,
        claim 99, and then release 99, you will have exceeded the 200% limit. At
        that point you are blocked from claiming any more numbers until you open
        an Amazon Web Services support ticket.</p>

        change.</p> <p>Updates routing priority and age on the contact
        (<b>QueuePriority</b> and <b>QueueTimeAdjustmentInSeconds</b>). These
        properties can be used to change a customer's position in the queue. For
        example, you can move a contact to the back of the queue by setting a
        lower routing priority relative to other contacts in queue; or you can
        move a contact to the front of the queue by increasing the routing age
        which will make the contact look artificially older and therefore higher
        up in the first-in-first-out routing order. Note that adjusting the
        routing age of a contact affects only its position in queue, and not its
        actual queue wait time as reported through metrics. These properties can
        also be updated by using <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/change-routing-priority.html">the
        Set routing priority / age flow block</a>.</p>
