    <p>Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows
    you to run open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes
    Service (Amazon EKS). With this deployment option, you can focus on running
    analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on EKS builds, configures, and manages
    containers for open-source applications. For more information about Amazon
    EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see <a
    href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html">What
    is shared id="EMR-EKS"/&gt;</a>.</p> <p> <i>Amazon EMR containers</i> is the
    API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The <code>emr-containers</code> prefix is
    used in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the prefix in the
    CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, <code>aws emr-containers
    start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix before IAM policy
    actions for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, <code>"Action": [
    "emr-containers:StartJobRun"]</code>. For more information, see <a

    actions for Amazon EMR on EKS</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix used
    in Amazon EMR on EKS service endpoints. For example,
    <code>emr-containers.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>. For more information,

paths:
  /virtualclusters/{virtualClusterId}/jobruns/{jobRunId}:
    GET:
      summary: DescribeJobRun
      description: >-
        <p>Displays detailed information about a job run. A job run is a unit of
        work, such as a Spark jar, PySpark script, or SparkSQL query, that you
        submit to Amazon EMR on EKS.</p>
  /jobtemplates:
    GET:
      summary: ListJobTemplates
      description: >-
        <p>Lists job templates based on a set of parameters. Job template stores
        values of StartJobRun API request in a template and can be used to start
        a job run. Job template allows two use cases: avoid repeating recurring
        StartJobRun API request values, enforcing certain values in StartJobRun
        API request.</p>
  /virtualclusters/{virtualClusterId}/endpoints:
    GET:
      summary: ListManagedEndpoints
      description: >-
        <p>Lists managed endpoints based on a set of parameters. A managed
        endpoint is a gateway that connects Amazon EMR Studio to Amazon EMR on
        EKS so that Amazon EMR Studio can communicate with your virtual
        cluster.</p>
  /virtualclusters:
    GET:
      summary: ListVirtualClusters
      description: >-
        <p>Lists information about the specified virtual cluster. Virtual
        cluster is a managed entity on Amazon EMR on EKS. You can create,
        describe, list and delete virtual clusters. They do not consume any
        additional resource in your system. A single virtual cluster maps to a
        single Kubernetes namespace. Given this relationship, you can model
        virtual clusters the same way you model Kubernetes namespaces to meet
        your requirements.</p>
