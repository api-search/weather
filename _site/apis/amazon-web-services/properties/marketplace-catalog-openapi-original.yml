    <p>Catalog API actions allow you to manage your entities through list,
    describe, and update capabilities. An entity can be a product or an offer on
    AWS Marketplace. </p> <p>You can automate your entity update process by
    integrating the AWS Marketplace Catalog API with your AWS Marketplace
    product build or deployment pipelines. You can also create your own
    applications on top of the Catalog API to manage your products on AWS
    Marketplace.</p>

  /StartChangeSet:

      summary: StartChangeSet
      description: >-
        <p>Allows you to request changes for your entities. Within a single
        <code>ChangeSet</code>, you can't start the same change type against the
        same entity multiple times. Additionally, when a <code>ChangeSet</code>
        is running, all the entities targeted by the different changes are
        locked until the change set has completed (either succeeded, cancelled,
        or failed). If you try to start a change set containing a change against
        an entity that is already locked, you will receive a
        <code>ResourceInUseException</code> error.</p> <p>For example, you can't
        start the <code>ChangeSet</code> described in the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace-catalog/latest/api-reference/API_StartChangeSet.html#API_StartChangeSet_Examples">example</a>
        later in this topic because it contains two changes to run the same
        change type (<code>AddRevisions</code>) against the same entity
        (<code>entity-id@1</code>).</p> <p>For more information about working
