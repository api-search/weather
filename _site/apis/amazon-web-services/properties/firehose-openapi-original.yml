    Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that delivers real-time
    streaming data to destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
    S3), Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon Redshift, Splunk, and various other
    supportd destinations.</p>

      summary: UpdateDestination
      description: >-
        <p>Updates the specified destination of the specified delivery
        stream.</p> <p>Use this operation to change the destination type (for
        example, to replace the Amazon S3 destination with Amazon Redshift) or
        change the parameters associated with a destination (for example, to
        change the bucket name of the Amazon S3 destination). The update might
        not occur immediately. The target delivery stream remains active while
        the configurations are updated, so data writes to the delivery stream
        can continue during this process. The updated configurations are usually
        effective within a few minutes.</p> <p>Switching between Amazon
        OpenSearch Service and other services is not supported. For an Amazon
        OpenSearch Service destination, you can only update to another Amazon
        OpenSearch Service destination.</p> <p>If the destination type is the
        same, Kinesis Data Firehose merges the configuration parameters
        specified with the destination configuration that already exists on the
        delivery stream. If any of the parameters are not specified in the call,
        the existing values are retained. For example, in the Amazon S3
        destination, if <a>EncryptionConfiguration</a> is not specified, then
        the existing <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code> is maintained on the
        destination.</p> <p>If the destination type is not the same, for
        example, changing the destination from Amazon S3 to Amazon Redshift,
        Kinesis Data Firehose does not merge any parameters. In this case, all
        parameters must be specified.</p> <p>Kinesis Data Firehose uses
        <code>CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId</code> to avoid race conditions and
        conflicting merges. This is a required field, and the service updates
        the configuration only if the existing configuration has a version ID
        that matches. After the update is applied successfully, the version ID
        is updated, and can be retrieved using <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.
        Use the new version ID to set
        <code>CurrentDeliveryStreamVersionId</code> in the next call.</p>
