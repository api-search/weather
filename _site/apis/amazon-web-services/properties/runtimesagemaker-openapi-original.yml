      summary: InvokeEndpoint
      description: >-
        <p>After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker
        hosting services, your client applications use this API to get
        inferences from the model hosted at the specified endpoint. </p> <p>For
        an overview of Amazon SageMaker, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/how-it-works.html">How
        It Works</a>. </p> <p>Amazon SageMaker strips all POST headers except
        those supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional
        headers. You should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those
        enumerated in the request syntax. </p> <p>Calls to
        <code>InvokeEndpoint</code> are authenticated by using Amazon Web
        Services Signature Version 4. For information, see <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-authenticating-requests.html">Authenticating
        Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4)</a> in the <i>Amazon
        S3 API Reference</i>.</p> <p>A customer's model containers must respond
        to requests within 60 seconds. The model itself can have a maximum
        processing time of 60 seconds before responding to invocations. If your
        model is going to take 50-60 seconds of processing time, the SDK socket
        timeout should be set to be 70 seconds.</p> <note> <p>Endpoints are
        scoped to an individual account, and are not public. The URL does not
        contain the account ID, but Amazon SageMaker determines the account ID
        from the authentication token that is supplied by the caller.</p>

    POST:
      summary: InvokeEndpointAsync
      description: >-
        <p>After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker
        hosting services, your client applications use this API to get
        inferences from the model hosted at the specified endpoint in an
        asynchronous manner.</p> <p>Inference requests sent to this API are
        enqueued for asynchronous processing. The processing of the inference
        request may or may not complete before you receive a response from this
        API. The response from this API will not contain the result of the
        inference request but contain information about where you can locate
        it.</p> <p>Amazon SageMaker strips all POST headers except those
        supported by the API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You
        should not rely on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in
        the request syntax. </p> <p>Calls to <code>InvokeEndpointAsync</code>

  /endpoints/{EndpointName}/invocations-response-stream:
    POST:
      summary: InvokeEndpointWithResponseStream
      description: >-
        <p>Invokes a model at the specified endpoint to return the inference
        response as a stream. The inference stream provides the response payload
        incrementally as a series of parts. Before you can get an inference
        stream, you must have access to a model that's deployed using Amazon
        SageMaker hosting services, and the container for that model must
        support inference streaming.</p> <p>For more information that can help
        you use this API, see the following sections in the <i>Amazon SageMaker
        Developer Guide</i>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>For information about how to add
