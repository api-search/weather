    Amazon SimpleDB is a web service providing the core database functions of
    data indexing and querying in the cloud. By offloading the time and effort
    associated with building and operating a web-scale database, SimpleDB
    provides developers the freedom to focus on application development. <p> A
    traditional, clustered relational database requires a sizable upfront
    capital outlay, is complex to design, and often requires extensive and
    repetitive database administration. Amazon SimpleDB is dramatically simpler,
    requiring no schema, automatically indexing your data and providing a simple
    API for storage and access. This approach eliminates the administrative
    burden of data modeling, index maintenance, and performance tuning.
    Developers gain access to this functionality within Amazon's proven
    computing environment, are able to scale instantly, and pay only for what
    they use. </p> <p> Visit <a

      summary: Select
      description: >-
        <p> The <code>Select</code> operation returns a set of attributes for
        <code>ItemNames</code> that match the select expression.
        <code>Select</code> is similar to the standard SQL SELECT statement.
        </p> <p> The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total
        size. Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned
        per page to enforce this limit. For example, if the client asks to
        retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the
        system returns 100 items and an appropriate <code>NextToken</code> so
        the client can access the next page of results. </p> <p> For information
        on how to construct select expressions, see Using Select to Create
        Amazon SimpleDB Queries in the Developer Guide. </p>
