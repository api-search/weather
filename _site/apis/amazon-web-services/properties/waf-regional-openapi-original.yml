        deletes <a>XssMatchTuple</a> objects (filters) in an <a>XssMatchSet</a>.
        For each <code>XssMatchTuple</code> object, you specify the following
        values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Action</code>: Whether to insert the
        object into or delete the object from the array. To change an
        <code>XssMatchTuple</code>, you delete the existing object and add a new
        one.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>FieldToMatch</code>: The part of web
        requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect and, if you want AWS WAF to
        inspect a header or custom query parameter, the name of the header or
        parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>TextTransformation</code>: Which
        text transformation, if any, to perform on the web request before
        inspecting the request for cross-site scripting attacks.</p> <p>You can
        only specify a single type of TextTransformation.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You
        use <code>XssMatchSet</code> objects to specify which CloudFront
        requests that you want to allow, block, or count. For example, if you're
        receiving requests that contain cross-site scripting attacks in the
        request body and you want to block the requests, you can create an
        <code>XssMatchSet</code> with the applicable settings, and then
        configure AWS WAF to block the requests. </p> <p>To create and configure
        an <code>XssMatchSet</code>, perform the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>
        <p>Submit a <a>CreateXssMatchSet</a> request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use
        <a>GetChangeToken</a> to get the change token that you provide in the
        <code>ChangeToken</code> parameter of an <a>UpdateIPSet</a> request.</p>
        </li> <li> <p>Submit an <code>UpdateXssMatchSet</code> request to
        specify the parts of web requests that you want AWS WAF to inspect for
        cross-site scripting attacks.</p> </li> </ol> <p>For more information
        about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see
