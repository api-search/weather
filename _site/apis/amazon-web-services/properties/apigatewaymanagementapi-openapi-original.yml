    <p>The Amazon API Gateway Management API allows you to directly manage
    runtime aspects of your deployed APIs. To use it, you must explicitly set
    the SDK's endpoint to point to the endpoint of your deployed API. The
    endpoint will be of the form
    https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}, or will be the
    endpoint corresponding to your API's custom domain and base path, if
    applicable.</p>
