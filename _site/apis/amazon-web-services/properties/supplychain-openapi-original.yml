    <p> AWS Supply Chain is a cloud-based application that works with your
    enterprise resource planning (ERP) and supply chain management systems.
    Using AWS Supply Chain, you can connect and extract your inventory, supply,
    and demand related data from existing ERP or supply chain systems into a
    single data model. </p> <p>The AWS Supply Chain API supports configuration
    data import for Supply Planning.</p> <p> All AWS Supply chain API operations
    are Amazon-authenticated and certificate-signed. They not only require the
    use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of AWS Identity and
    Access Management users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and
    permission policies. </p>
