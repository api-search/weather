    <p>Amazon EMR Serverless is a new deployment option for Amazon EMR. Amazon
    EMR Serverless provides a serverless runtime environment that simplifies
    running analytics applications using the latest open source frameworks such
    as Apache Spark and Apache Hive. With Amazon EMR Serverless, you donâ€™t have
    to configure, optimize, secure, or operate clusters to run applications with
    these frameworks.</p> <p>The API reference to Amazon EMR Serverless is
    <code>emr-serverless</code>. The <code>emr-serverless</code> prefix is used
    in the following scenarios: </p> <ul> <li> <p>It is the prefix in the CLI
    commands for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>aws emr-serverless
    start-job-run</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix before IAM policy
    actions for Amazon EMR Serverless. For example, <code>"Action":
    ["emr-serverless:StartJobRun"]</code>. For more information, see <a

    actions for Amazon EMR Serverless</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>It is the prefix
    used in Amazon EMR Serverless service endpoints. For example,
    <code>emr-serverless.us-east-2.amazonaws.com</code>.</p> </li> </ul>
