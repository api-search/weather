    <p>The CloudTrail Data Service lets you ingest events into CloudTrail from
    any source in your hybrid environments, such as in-house or SaaS
    applications hosted on-premises or in the cloud, virtual machines, or
    containers. You can store, access, analyze, troubleshoot and take action on
    this data without maintaining multiple log aggregators and reporting tools.
    After you run <code>PutAuditEvents</code> to ingest your application
    activity into CloudTrail, you can use CloudTrail Lake to search, query, and
    analyze the data that is logged from your applications.</p>

        <p>Ingests your application events into CloudTrail Lake. A required
        parameter, <code>auditEvents</code>, accepts the JSON records (also
        called <i>payload</i>) of events that you want CloudTrail to ingest. You
        can add up to 100 of these events (or up to 1 MB) per
        <code>PutAuditEvents</code> request.</p>
