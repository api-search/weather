    <p>Amazon Web Services X-Ray provides APIs for managing debug traces and
    retrieving service maps and other data created by processing those
    traces.</p>
paths:
  /Traces:
    POST:
      summary: BatchGetTraces
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves a list of traces specified by ID. Each trace is a
        collection of segment documents that originates from a single request.
        Use <code>GetTraceSummaries</code> to get a list of trace IDs.</p>
  /CreateGroup:
    POST:
      summary: CreateGroup
      description: <p>Creates a group resource with a name and a filter expression. </p>
  /CreateSamplingRule:
    POST:
      summary: CreateSamplingRule
      description: >-
        <p>Creates a rule to control sampling behavior for instrumented
        applications. Services retrieve rules with <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingRules.html">GetSamplingRules</a>,
        and evaluate each rule in ascending order of <i>priority</i> for each
        request. If a rule matches, the service records a trace, borrowing it
        from the reservoir size. After 10 seconds, the service reports back to
        X-Ray with <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/api/API_GetSamplingTargets.html">GetSamplingTargets</a>
        to get updated versions of each in-use rule. The updated rule contains a
        trace quota that the service can use instead of borrowing from the
        reservoir.</p>

        <p>X-Ray reevaluates insights periodically until they're resolved, and
        records each intermediate state as an event. You can review an insight's
        events in the Impact Timeline on the Inspect page in the X-Ray

  /SamplingTargets:
    POST:
      summary: GetSamplingTargets
      description: >-
        <p>Requests a sampling quota for rules that the service is using to
        sample requests. </p>
  /ServiceGraph:
    POST:
      summary: GetServiceGraph
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves a document that describes services that process incoming
        requests, and downstream services that they call as a result. Root
        services process incoming requests and make calls to downstream
        services. Root services are applications that use the <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html">Amazon Web Services
        X-Ray SDK</a>. Downstream services can be other applications, Amazon Web

      summary: GetTraceGraph
      description: <p>Retrieves a service graph for one or more specific trace IDs.</p>
  /TraceSummaries:
    POST:
      summary: GetTraceSummaries
      description: >-
        <p>Retrieves IDs and annotations for traces available for a specified
        time frame using an optional filter. To get the full traces, pass the
        trace IDs to <code>BatchGetTraces</code>.</p> <p>A filter expression can
        target traced requests that hit specific service nodes or edges, have
        errors, or come from a known user. For example, the following filter
        expression targets traces that pass through
        <code>api.example.com</code>:</p> <p>
        <code>service("api.example.com")</code> </p> <p>This filter expression
        finds traces that have an annotation named <code>account</code> with the
        value <code>12345</code>:</p> <p> <code>annotation.account =
        "12345"</code> </p> <p>For a full list of indexed fields and keywords
        that you can use in filter expressions, see <a

  /TraceSegments:
    POST:
      summary: PutTraceSegments
      description: >-
        <p>Uploads segment documents to Amazon Web Services X-Ray. The <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/index.html">X-Ray SDK</a>
        generates segment documents and sends them to the X-Ray daemon, which
        uploads them in batches. A segment document can be a completed segment,
        an in-progress segment, or an array of subsegments.</p> <p>Segments must
        include the following fields. For the full segment document schema, see
        <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-api-segmentdocuments.html">Amazon
        Web Services X-Ray Segment Documents</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services
        X-Ray Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p class="title"> <b>Required segment
        document fields</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>name</code> - The name of
        the service that handled the request.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>id</code>
        - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same
        trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> <li> <p>
        <code>trace_id</code> - A unique identifier that connects all segments
        and subsegments originating from a single client request.</p> </li> <li>
        <p> <code>start_time</code> - Time the segment or subsegment was
        created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to
        milliseconds. For example, <code>1480615200.010</code> or
        <code>1.480615200010E9</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>end_time</code>
        - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example,
        <code>1480615200.090</code> or <code>1.480615200090E9</code>. Specify
        either an <code>end_time</code> or <code>in_progress</code>.</p> </li>
        <li> <p> <code>in_progress</code> - Set to <code>true</code> instead of
        specifying an <code>end_time</code> to record that a segment has been
        started, but is not complete. Send an in-progress segment when your
        application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to
        trace that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the
        complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.</p> </li> </ul>
        <p>A <code>trace_id</code> consists of three numbers separated by
        hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This
        includes:</p> <p class="title"> <b>Trace ID Format</b> </p> <ul> <li>
        <p>The version number, for instance, <code>1</code>.</p> </li> <li>
        <p>The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8
        hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch
        time is <code>1480615200</code> seconds, or <code>58406520</code> in
        hexadecimal.</p> </li> <li> <p>A 96-bit identifier for the trace,
        globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.</p> </li> </ul>
