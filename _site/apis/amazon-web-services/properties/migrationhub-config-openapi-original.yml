    <p>The AWS Migration Hub home region APIs are available specifically for
    working with your Migration Hub home region. You can use these APIs to
    determine a home region, as well as to create and work with controls that
    describe the home region.</p> <ul> <li> <p>You must make API calls for write
    actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in
    your home region, or a <code>HomeRegionNotSetException</code> error is
    returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>API calls for read actions (list, describe,
    stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region.</p> </li> <li>
    <p>If you call a write API outside the home region, an
    <code>InvalidInputException</code> is returned.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can
    call <code>GetHomeRegion</code> action to obtain the account's Migration Hub
    home region.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For specific API usage, see the sections
    that follow in this AWS Migration Hub Home Region API reference. </p>

        AWS Application Discovery Service and AWS Migration Hub APIs, to obtain
        the account's Migration Hub home region.</p>
